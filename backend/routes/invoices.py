# ============ Trade Credit Reversal Helpers =================================
# Used whenever an invoice that previously affected a trade customer's credit
# ledger is undone — soft-delete, permanent delete, or admin restore. Both
# directions are idempotent via the `credits_reversed` flag stamped on the
# invoice doc, so a delete-then-permanent-delete sequence will NOT double-
# reverse. A subsequent `restore_invoice` re-applies (un-reverses).
#
# Behaviour:
#   • If the invoice ACCRUED `trade_credit_earned > 0` → subtract that from
#     the customer's balance and write a `reversed_earned_in_store` ledger row.
#   • If the invoice REDEEMED `credit_redeemed > 0` → add that BACK to the
#     customer's balance and write a `reversed_redeemed_in_store` ledger row.
#
# Direction:
#   reverse_invoice_credits(...) — undoes the credit movement (delete path)
#   reapply_invoice_credits(...) — re-applies the credit movement (restore)

# (currently 2%) when neither catalogue carries a rate for that SKU.

#   • `save_invoice()` — to compute the actual £ to accrue at save time.
#   • `POST /credit-back-rates` — so the EPOS frontend's "will earn £X
#     credit" preview pill stays in lock-step with the backend math.
# Keeping ONE source of truth prevents drift between the preview shown to
# staff and the figure that ultimately lands in the customer's ledger.
