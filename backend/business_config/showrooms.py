"""
Frozen, code-side copy of Tile Station showroom details.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The live `showrooms` MongoDB collection is the source of truth for the
storefront, but the AI City Landing Page generator (`routes/city_landing_pages.py`)
needs to inject real address / phone / postcode / opening-hours into its
LLM prompt every time it generates a page. Reading from MongoDB inside
the prompt builder works, but a frozen, version-controlled copy:

  • survives a DB outage,
  • makes the AI prompt deterministic and reviewable in code review,
  • lets us assign each town to its *nearest* showroom in one place.

If a showroom moves or a phone number changes, update this file AND the
DB record. Both must stay in sync. Last refreshed: Feb 2026 (from prod).
