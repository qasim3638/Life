## 2026-04-30 — 🗑️ Voided EPOS invoices now visibly faded on trader dashboard

### Bug
User reported after a real trade flow: trader paid in-store with £25 credit, staff deleted the invoice (credit + stock correctly reversed in backend ledger), but the trader's `/shop/trade/account` → Recent Orders still showed the deleted invoice as a normal "delivered" order. Also **Total Spent** stat still counted the deleted £60.

### Fix
**Backend**
- `routes/shop.py::get_shop_orders` — removed the bogus `is_deleted:{$ne:true}` filter (the real field is `deleted_at`). Now returns deleted + cancelled invoices WITH status, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by_name`, and a synthesised `void_reason` so the UI can explain what happened.
- `routes/invoices.py::reverse_invoice_credits` — now also decrements `shop_customers.total_spent` by `gross_total`, returning `total_spent_reversed` in the summary.
- `routes/invoices.py::reapply_invoice_credits` — mirror: re-increments `total_spent` on invoice restore, returns `total_spent_reapplied`.

**Frontend**
- `pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx` Recent Orders card — voided rows (status = `deleted` or `cancelled`) render with `opacity-70`, dashed border, line-through on order number + total, grey faded package icon. Status pill: `Deleted` = rose bold; `Cancelled` = amber bold. Inline italic rose text shows the void reason. Tooltip on hover shows `Deleted by staff — any credit-back or redeemed credit was automatically refunded · Voided on {date} · By {admin}`.
- Download VAT Invoice button + `−£X saved` pill both hidden on voided rows.

### Tested
- 3/3 credit-reversal pytests still PASS (test_epos_credit_flow, test_credit_reversal, test_refund_credit_reversal).
- Frontend: testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_137 reports 100% PASS on the voided-order UI spec. No regressions on live orders.

### Test IDs
`trader-recent-order-{orderId}`, `download-vat-invoice-btn-{orderId}` (hidden when voided).



## 2026-04-30 — 🔗 Contact Page now inherits from Homepage Footer (single source of truth)

### Bug
User reported that editing `Homepage Manager → Footer` phone/email was not reflecting on the Contact page's "Call Us" / email cards, AND also not on other shop pages' footers. Root cause: Contact page was reading from a completely separate `contact_settings` collection that had stale defaults like `01234 567890`.

### Fix
- `pages/shop/ContactPage.jsx` now ALSO fetches `/api/website-admin/footer-settings` and uses those values as the PRIMARY source for phone + general email. `contact_settings` remains as an advanced override for multi-email setups (orders@, quotes@, etc.).
- If the user maintains only ONE field (the Homepage Footer), it cascades to: top nav bar phone · site footer · Contact page Call Us card · Contact page "General Enquiries" email card.
- If the user wants multiple department emails (orders@, quotes@, …), Contact Settings still works and overrides the footer's single email.

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/ContactPage.jsx` — new `footerSettings` state + `fetchFooterSettings()`. `resolvedPhone` / `resolvedEmails` merge helpers prefer footer values, fall back to contact_settings.
- `frontend/src/components/shop/ShopLayout.js` — previous fix in this session (top bar + footer).

### Verified
- Preview: Contact page "Call Us" card renders `01732 424242` from `footer_settings.phone` (was `01234 567890` hardcoded default before).
- Screenshot confirmed: all 4 surfaces (top bar, footer, Call Us card, General Enquiries email card) now show the same values.



## 2026-04-30 — 🔧 Footer contact info: wired live to admin-saved values

### Bug
Admin reported that `Homepage Manager → Footer` fields for phone + email saved fine but NEVER reflected on the live customer footer. Top utility bar and footer showed hardcoded `01234 567890` / `info@tilestation.co.uk`.

### Root cause
Two independent bugs in `ShopLayout.js`:
1. It fetched a non-existent endpoint `/api/website-admin/homepage/footer` (the correct endpoint is `/api/website-admin/footer-settings`) — silently returned null and the UI fell through to hardcoded defaults.
2. Even when footerData was populated, the phone + email + hours fields were hardcoded in the JSX instead of reading from `footerData.phone` / `footerData.email`.

### Fix
- `components/shop/ShopLayout.js` now fetches the correct endpoint, normalises the admin's `{text, url}` link shape to the UI's `{label, url}`, and reads phone/email/hours dynamically. Top utility bar phone is now also driven by `footerData.phone` (hidden if not set).
- Falls through to sensible defaults only when the admin value is blank — never hides the footer during the initial fetch.

### Tested
- Backend endpoint returns `{settings: {phone, email, description, quickLinks, ...}}` with admin-saved values.
- Frontend fetch + render verified.
- No other places hardcoded these strings (grep confirmed — `ShopLayout.js` was the only renderer).


## 2026-04-30 — 🚨 Telegram ping when ribbon leak auto-scrubbed

### What
Extended the nightly ribbon-leak-cleanup job so it fires a Telegram notification the moment it scrubs anything. Admin sees `🚨 Ribbon leak scrubbed` on their phone within seconds — no waiting for log inspection.

### Backend
- `services/telegram_notify.py` — added `ribbon_leak` event (enabled by default).
- `services/scheduler.py` — the `ribbon_leak_cleanup` tick now calls `notify_event("ribbon_leak", ...)` whenever `docs_cleaned` or `history_entries_pruned > 0`. Honours dedupe + per-event admin toggle.

### Verified
- 12 jobs registered on scheduler startup.
- Telegram event type `ribbon_leak` available for toggling via the existing admin panel.



## 2026-04-30 — 🌙 Nightly APScheduler job: ribbon-leak auto-scrub

### What
Added a nightly APScheduler job (`ribbon_leak_cleanup`, runs at **02:30 UTC**) that automatically calls the production-cleanup function against the live MongoDB. Even if a future test file is careless, any leaked `TEST_*` or `_E1_TEST_*` string gets purged within 24h — no customer ever sees a test fixture on the live site for more than one night.

### Belt-and-braces stack
Now there are **THREE** independent safety nets against ribbon test leaks:
1. **Prevention**: `test_announcement_ribbon_history.py` forces `enabled=false` on every PUT and runs the cleanup in its own teardown fixture.
2. **On-demand cure**: `tests/cleanup_ribbon_test_leaks.py` can be run manually against prod DB.
3. **Automatic cure**: The nightly APScheduler job runs the same cleanup function every night at 02:30 UTC and logs a `WARNING` if any test data was found so admins notice it in the daily logs.

### Backend
- `tests/cleanup_ribbon_test_leaks.py` — refactored from a CLI-only module to expose `async cleanup_ribbon_test_leaks(db=None, dry_run=False, logger=None)` that can be called directly by the scheduler AND still works as a CLI.
- `services/scheduler.py` — new `ribbon_leak_cleanup` job registered in `initialize_scheduler()`. Uses `CronTrigger(hour=2, minute=30)` off-peak. Logs a `WARNING` line if anything was cleaned (easy to spot in log-aggregation / alerting).

### Verified
- 6/6 `test_announcement_ribbon_history.py` still pass with refactored helper.
- Scheduler status endpoint confirms 12 jobs now registered, `ribbon_leak_cleanup` among them.
- End-to-end planted leak → cleanup runs → doc scrubbed, message blanked, real history entries preserved, test entries pruned.

### Test IDs
N/A (backend-only job + module)


## 2026-04-30 — 🧼 Test-leak prevention + production cleanup tool

### What
Rewrote `test_announcement_ribbon_history.py` with a session-scoped snapshot/restore fixture and migrated all test messages to `_E1_TEST_` prefix so they're trivially greppable. Added `tests/cleanup_ribbon_test_leaks.py` one-shot migration script to purge leaked test strings from the live DB.

See the 30-Apr session log: customer reported `TEST_PRESERVE_fields` in the top marketing ribbon on `tilestation.co.uk`. Root cause: earlier pytest had no teardown and ran against the live admin endpoint.

### Files
- `backend/tests/test_announcement_ribbon_history.py`
- `backend/tests/cleanup_ribbon_test_leaks.py`



## 2026-04-30 — 👤 Staff attribution on in-store EPOS VAT invoices

### What
Added an `Issued by {staff} at {showroom} on {date}` line to the footer of every VAT invoice PDF generated from an in-store EPOS invoice. Online orders skip this line cleanly (no staff attribution applies).

### Why
On disputes ("who served me?", "the till operator agreed a different price"), the trader can now see exactly who issued the invoice without phoning the showroom. Instant traceability — the data was already on the invoice doc (`staff_name` / `sales_person`), it just wasn't surfaced to the customer.

### Footer order
1. `Thank you for your business. Tile Station · Co. No: NNNN · VAT: GB NNN`
2. **`Issued by Sarah Smith at Tonbridge Showroom on 30/04/2026`** ← NEW (in-store only)
3. `Goods remain the property of the supplier until payment is received in full.`

### Backend
- `routes/shop.py` — endpoint passes `_in_store_staff_name` + `_in_store_invoice_date` through to the PDF generator.
- `services/vat_invoice_pdf.py` — footer block conditionally renders the staff line only when BOTH `staff_name` and `showroom_name` are present (defensive: never appears on online orders, never shows orphan "Issued by ..." with missing parts).

### Tested
- 9/9 backend pytest still PASS (`test_vat_invoice_pdf.py`).
- Visual PDF inspection confirmed exact footer text: `Issued by Sarah Smith at Tonbridge Showroom on 30/04/2026`.


## 2026-04-30 — 🐛 Fix: VAT invoice 404 on linked in-store EPOS orders

### Bug
User reported a `404 — Could not download invoice` toast when clicking the download button on Recent Orders. Root cause: orders shown on the trader dashboard are merged from TWO collections (`shop_orders` + `invoices` filtered by `linked_shop_customer_id`), but the new `/vat-invoice.pdf` endpoint only checked `shop_orders`. EPOS-linked invoices (the `INV-NNNNN` ones from the screenshot) returned 404.

### Fix
- **Backend** (`routes/shop.py`): Endpoint now falls back to `invoices` collection when no online order matches, normalising the EPOS doc shape (`gross_total`→`total`, `line_items[].due_price`→`items[].price`, `customer_address`→`delivery_address`) into a single dict before passing to the PDF generator. Cross-customer protection still enforced via `linked_shop_customer_id` scope.
- **PDF generator** (`services/vat_invoice_pdf.py`): Honours the EPOS `apply_vat=False` flag — renders `VAT @ 0%` on the totals row + per-line column when staff opted out of VAT at the till. Surfaces the showroom name as a suffix on the invoice title (`VAT INVOICE · Tonbridge Showroom`) so traders know which physical store issued the invoice.

### Tested
- 9/9 backend pytest PASS (`test_vat_invoice_pdf.py`) — added 3 new cases: linked EPOS invoice download, cross-customer EPOS access blocked (404), and zero-VAT EPOS invoice path.
- Visual PDF inspection confirmed totals reconcile correctly for both online (£100 + £20 VAT = £120) and EPOS (£50 + £10 VAT = £60) invoices.

### Files
- `backend/routes/shop.py` (endpoint with fallback)
- `backend/services/vat_invoice_pdf.py` (apply_vat handling + showroom suffix)
- `backend/tests/test_vat_invoice_pdf.py` (3 new cases)


## 2026-04-30 — 📄 Downloadable UK VAT invoice PDFs on trader dashboard

### What
Traders can now download a HMRC-compliant VAT invoice PDF for any of their own orders directly from `/shop/trade/account` — no need to email the showroom or wait for staff to issue one. Buttons appear in two places: an icon-only button next to each Recent Order on the Dashboard tab, and a labelled `Download VAT Invoice` button on each order in the full Order History tab.

### What's in the PDF (HMRC-validated)
- "VAT INVOICE" title
- Supplier name + address + VAT registration number (configurable via env vars: `COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_VAT_NO`, etc.)
- Customer business name + trade ref (T-NNNNN)
- Unique invoice number + tax point date
- Line items with qty + unit price ex-VAT + 20% VAT rate
- Subtotal ex-VAT, VAT @ 20%, optional delivery, gross total
- Optional trade-savings note when `savings_meta` is present
- Footer with company number + VAT number

### Backend
- New `services/vat_invoice_pdf.py` — UK VAT-compliant reportlab generator. Supplier defaults overridable via env vars; back-derives VAT from `subtotal × 0.20` with fallback math for legacy orders.
- New `GET /api/shop/orders/{order_id}/vat-invoice.pdf` in `routes/shop.py`. Scoped by `customer_id` so customers cannot enumerate other people's orders. Streams via `StreamingResponse` with proper `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="VAT_Invoice_{order_no}.pdf"`.

### Frontend
- `pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx` — new `downloadOrderVatInvoice(order)` helper using fetch + JWT bearer + blob → `<a>.click()` pipeline + sonner toast loading→success transition. Two buttons added:
  - Dashboard tab: icon-only FileText button on Recent Orders rows (data-testid=`download-vat-invoice-btn-{orderId}`)
  - Orders tab: labelled `Download VAT Invoice` button in items-count footer (data-testid=`download-vat-invoice-full-{orderId}`)

### Tested
- Backend: 6/6 pytest PASS (`test_vat_invoice_pdf.py`) — HTTP 200, `application/pdf`, attachment header, %PDF magic bytes, cross-customer 404, unauth 401, unknown order 404. PDF visually inspected and confirmed HMRC-compliant.
- Frontend: 100% PASS (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_136) — Playwright triggered both buttons, captured download events, verified filename + ~3KB PDF size + magic bytes + toast progression. No regressions.

### Test IDs
`download-vat-invoice-btn-{orderId}`, `download-vat-invoice-full-{orderId}`.


## 2026-04-30 — 📅 Month filter on trader Credit history

### What
Added a `📅 All months ({count})` dropdown above the trader's Credit history list. Selecting a month filters the visible events and reveals a summary chip showing the per-month aggregate (`N events in March 2026 · +£X earned · −£Y redeemed`). All driven off the events array — zero new API calls.

### Why
For active traders with 30+ events in their history, hunting for "what did I earn in March?" used to mean a manual scroll through the timeline. Now: one click and they see ONLY March, with a clean per-month summary that maps directly to a calendar month an accountant cares about.

### UX details
- Dropdown only renders when the trader has events spanning **2+ distinct months** (no point filtering 1 month).
- Options listed newest-first with counts: `April 2026 (1)`, `March 2026 (2)`, `February 2026 (1)`.
- Switching the filter ALSO collapses any open breakdown (clean visual reset).
- "Show all months" link in the empty-month state offers a one-click escape.
- Filter is client-side only — no extra backend hits, snappy switch.

### Frontend
- `pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx` — new state `creditMonthFilter`. IIFE inside the Credit history card derives `monthBuckets` (Map) + `monthOptions` (sorted newest-first) + `filteredEvents` from `creditEvents.events`. Summary chip (data-testid=`credit-history-month-summary`) sums earn vs redeem amounts per month.

### Tested
- 100% PASS frontend Playwright (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_135). 4-event multi-month seed verified: dropdown rendering, option counts, filter behaviour, summary chip, breakdown collapse on filter change, single-month customers correctly hide the dropdown.
- Backend: untouched. All 7 prior credit pytest scripts still PASS.

### Test IDs
`credit-history-month-filter`, `credit-history-month-summary`, `credit-history-empty-month`, `credit-history-clear-filter`.


## 2026-04-30 — 🧾 Trader-facing Credit history with per-product breakdown

### What
Closed the credit-back ecosystem loop. New "Credit history" card on the trader's `/shop/trade/account` → Discount tab merges every credit event from BOTH channels (online orders + in-store EPOS invoices) into one timeline. Each event with a per-product breakdown can be expanded inline to reveal the same itemised audit table the staff and email surfaces show. Copy button included so traders can grab a plain-text version for their accountant.

### The 5 surfaces now in sync
1. EPOS chip live preview (`Will earn £X — Show breakdown ⌄`)
2. EPOS chip expanded breakdown panel + Copy
3. Trade Credit Earned email body (auto-sent on each EPOS invoice)
4. Admin `/admin/sales-hub` Credit Emails card → Preview expansion + Copy
5. **NEW**: Trader's own `/shop/trade/account` → Discount tab → Credit history card → Show breakdown + Copy

### Backend
- New `GET /api/shop/trade/credit-history-detailed` (auth required, trader JWT). Merges events from `trade_credits` (online pipeline) + `credit_transactions` filtered to `earned_in_store|redeemed_in_store` (EPOS pipeline). For EPOS earn events, joins against `invoices` collection in a single batch find() (no N+1) to attach the `trade_credit_breakdown` array. Returns events sorted newest-first, with aggregates `total_earned` + `total_redeemed`.

### Frontend
- `pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx` — new state `creditEvents` / `expandedEventId` / `copiedEventId`, new `fetchCreditHistory()` and `copyEventBreakdown(ev)` helpers. New "Credit history" card renders below "How Discount Tiers Work" inside the Discount tab. Each event shows: type pill (+ Earned / − Redeemed), channel (In-store / Online), source ref, date, £ amount; breakdown expansion + Copy button mirror the EPOS chip UX exactly.

### Tested
- Backend: 7/7 pytest assertions PASS (`test_trade_credit_history.py`) — newest-first ordering, EPOS breakdown attached, online events have null breakdown, redemption events negative amount, aggregates correct.
- Frontend: 100% PASS (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_134) — login + Discount tab + breakdown expand/collapse + Copy button + clipboard contents + empty state + single-open invariant + null-breakdown rows correctly hide toggle.
- All 7 prior credit-flow regressions still PASS.

### Test IDs
`credit-history-card`, `credit-history-empty`, `credit-history-event-{id}`, `credit-history-toggle-{id}`, `credit-history-breakdown-{id}`, `credit-history-breakdown-row-{id}-{idx}`, `credit-history-copy-{id}`.


## 2026-04-30 — 🔍 Inline "Preview" + Copy on Credit Emails audit card

### What
Closed the loop on the `/admin/sales-hub` Trade Credit Emails card. Each row now exposes a `Preview ⌄` button under the £credit cell — one click expands a sibling table row showing the **exact per-product breakdown the trader received** in their email body, plus a `Copy` button to grab a plain-text version for replying.

### Why
Before this, admins could see *that* the email was sent (sent/failed pill) but not *what was inside it*. When a trader queried "I got £5 — for which lines?", staff had to dig into the invoice doc or open their own copy of the email. Now: one click reveals the same itemised audit table the trader is looking at, plus a 2-second Copy → paste into the WhatsApp / email reply.

### Frontend
- `components/admin/RecentCreditEmailsCard.jsx` — added `expandedId` + `copiedId` state; wraps each row in `<React.Fragment>` with a sibling expanded `<tr colSpan={6}>` containing the breakdown panel. Single-open invariant — clicking another row's Preview collapses the first.
- New `handleCopyBreakdown(row)` re-uses the exact clipboard pipeline + monospace format from the EPOS TradeCustomerChip (iter 132). Header line includes business + T-ref + invoice number.
- Preview button is gated on `breakdown.length > 0` — legacy rows without a breakdown don't show it.

### Backend
- `routes/invoices.py::list_credit_emails` projection extended to include `trade_credit_breakdown` + `subtotal`. Minimal payload increase, no N+1.

### Tested
- 21/21 frontend Playwright assertions PASS (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_133).
- Backend curl confirmed breakdown[] now in `GET /api/invoices/credit-emails/recent` payload. 3/3 regression pytests still PASS.

### Test IDs
`credit-email-preview-toggle-{id}`, `credit-email-breakdown-{id}`, `credit-email-breakdown-row-{id}-{idx}`, `credit-email-copy-{id}`.


## 2026-04-30 — 📧 Per-line credit breakdown on trade credit email

### What
Extended the "You just earned £X credit" Resend email (fires on every EPOS invoice that accrues credit) to render a full per-product breakdown table under the summary card. Each line item on the invoice appears as its own row showing product name + rate × net + £ credit — exactly what the trader's accountant needs for month-end reconciliation.

### Email preview
```
┌──── PER-PRODUCT CREDIT BREAKDOWN ────────────────────┐
│ Each line on this invoice earns credit at its rate.   │
├───────────────────────────┬──────────────┬───────────┤
│ PRODUCT                   │ RATE × NET   │ CREDIT    │
├───────────────────────────┼──────────────┼───────────┤
│ Premium Marble Tile       │ 8% × £50.00  │   £4.00   │
│ Bathroom Sealer           │ 2% × £50.00  │   £1.00   │
├───────────────────────────┴──────────────┼───────────┤
│ Total credit earned                       │   £5.00   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘
  Forward this email to your accountant for itemised records.
```

### Why
Before: trader got "You earned £5 (5.0% of £100 net)" — fine, but when they forwarded it to their accountant the figure appeared out of thin air. Now: the forward arrives with audit-grade line-by-line proof, making the credit-back programme feel far more professional and reducing accountant queries.

### Backend
- `services/email.py::send_trade_credit_earned_email` — reads `invoice.trade_credit_breakdown[]` (already stamped by `routes/invoices.py` since the 30-Apr per-product rollout). Renders each row as a `<tr>` with inline styles compatible across Gmail / Outlook / Apple Mail. Long product names (>48 chars) truncated server-side with `…` so narrow Gmail-mobile views don't overflow. Panel is **omitted entirely** when `trade_credit_breakdown` is absent (legacy invoices unchanged).

### Tested
- 3/3 assertions in new pytest `test_credit_email_breakdown.py` — verifies: (a) breakdown table renders with all expected text, (b) long names truncated to 47 chars + ellipsis, (c) legacy invoices without breakdown render cleanly without the panel.
- Regression: 4/4 other EPOS credit pytest scripts still PASS (test_epos_credit_flow, test_credit_reversal, test_refund_credit_reversal, test_credit_email_audit).


## 2026-04-30 — 📋 "Copy breakdown" button on EPOS credit panel

### What
Added a `📋 Copy breakdown` button inside the per-line credit-back audit panel on the EPOS Invoice page. One click copies a monospace-aligned plain-text table to the clipboard — pastes cleanly into WhatsApp, email, SMS, or any text field.

### Example output
```
Credit-back breakdown — Acme Tiles Ltd (T-AED9E)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Premium Marble Tile           8% × £50.00        £4.00
Bathroom Sealer               2% × £50.00        £1.00
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total credit                                     £5.00
```

### Why
When a tradesman asks for the credit-back numbers in writing (WhatsApp is the dominant channel in the UK trade), staff can now forward the exact audit-grade breakdown in 2 seconds rather than retyping it (and risking fat-finger arithmetic).

### Frontend
- `components/admin/TradeCustomerChip.jsx` — new `handleCopyBreakdown()` uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with a `document.execCommand('copy')` fallback textarea for non-HTTPS / legacy browsers. Monospace alignment via `padEnd(28)` for name column + `padEnd(18)` for rate×net column. Button toggles label between `Copy breakdown` (ClipboardCopy icon) and `✓ Copied` (Check icon) for 1.8s after click. sonner toast confirms success for 2.2s.
- Button correctly gated inside `{showBreakdown && creditBreakdown.length > 0}` block — never orphaned when panel is closed.

### Tested
- 13/13 frontend test steps PASS (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_132) — includes clipboard-content verification via `navigator.clipboard.readText()`, label flip/revert timing, toast rendering, and conditional rendering regression.
- Backend credit-back-rates preview endpoint unchanged — regression pytest PASSED.

### Test IDs
`epos-credit-breakdown-copy`.


## 2026-04-30 — 📋 "Show breakdown" panel on EPOS credit pill

### What
Added a one-click `Show breakdown ⌄` toggle inside the green "Will earn £X credit" pill on the EPOS Invoice page. One click opens a receipt-style per-line audit table showing exactly how each product on the invoice contributes to the total credit-back (e.g. *"Premium Tile · 8% × £50 = £4.00"*). Collapsible — hidden by default, zero clutter until staff need it.

### Why
Till staff can now confidently answer *"how did you get £X?"* in 3 seconds when a tradesman queries the credit-back figure, without calling a manager or digging through spreadsheets. Also catches stray zero-rate products early — if a £200 tile shows 0% by mistake, staff spot it before the invoice is saved.

### Frontend
- `components/admin/TradeCustomerChip.jsx` — new `creditBreakdown` prop. Clicking the `Show breakdown` button (ChevronDown) reveals a small `<table>` with one row per line item: product name (truncated to 38 chars), rate × net calculation, and £ credit. Bottom row shows `Total credit £X.XX`. Toggle flips to `Hide breakdown` (ChevronUp). aria-expanded flips correctly.
- `pages/admin/Invoice.js` — `creditPreview` state now carries the `breakdown` array returned by `/api/invoices/credit-back-rates`; passed straight into the chip.
- Gated by `earnedPreview > 0 && accrualEnabled === true && creditBreakdown.length > 0` — so it never orphans when in_store_credit is OFF or cart is empty.

### Tested
- 8/8 frontend acceptance criteria PASS (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_131).
- Backend preview endpoint still returns the breakdown[] array with correct per-row product_name/sku/rate/net/credit fields.
- Trade tier badges/medals still globally hidden.

### Test IDs
`epos-credit-breakdown-toggle`, `epos-credit-breakdown-panel`, `epos-credit-breakdown-row-{idx}`, `epos-credit-breakdown-total`.


## 2026-04-30 — 🎯 Dynamic Per-Product Credit Back-rates in EPOS (Scenario 1)

### What
EPOS in-store credit accrual now mirrors the online shop **exactly**: every line item earns credit at THAT product's own `credit_back_rate` (set per-product on `supplier_products` and `tiles`), with a 2% global fallback when the product has no specific rate. Replaced the legacy "flat customer-level credit_rate × subtotal" formula with a true line-by-line walk.

### Why
Trade customers were quoting the same job in-store and online and seeing different £ credit-back amounts — confusing and eroding trust in the credit-back programme. Now both channels apply the same per-product % to each line, so the figure on the till matches the figure in the customer's online dashboard penny-for-penny.

### Backend (`/app/backend/routes/invoices.py`)
- New `_resolve_credit_back_rate(db, sku, product_id)` — single source of truth. Lookup priority: supplier_products → tiles → 2% global default (`TRADE_CREDIT_BACK_DEFAULT` from `business_rules.py`).
- New `_compute_per_line_credit(db, line_items, apply_vat)` — walks each line, applies the per-line rate, returns `{total_credit, total_net, breakdown[], blended_rate}`.
- `save_invoice()` updated: stamps `trade_credit_earned` (sum), `trade_credit_rate` (blended effective %), `trade_credit_breakdown[]` (per-line audit trail), and `trade_credit_customer_rate` (legacy customer-level rate, kept for older reports). Credit-transactions ledger description now reads *"Credit back from in-store invoice X (per-product rates, blended Y% of £Z net)"*.
- New `POST /api/invoices/credit-back-rates` preview endpoint — frontend calls this so the live "Will earn £X credit" pill matches the saved figure exactly. Returns `{total_credit, blended_rate, breakdown, default_rate}`.

### Frontend
- `components/admin/TradeCustomerChip.jsx` — accepts new `earnedCredit` + `blendedRate` props. Pill subtitle dynamically renders `(X.X% blended of £Y net)` when per-product calc is supplied, falls back to legacy `(X% of £Y net)` if not. OFF-warning rule unchanged.
- `pages/admin/Invoice.js` — new `creditPreview` state + 350ms-debounced effect that signs lineItems by `[productId, sku, qty, duePrice/price, isReturn]` and POSTs to the preview endpoint whenever the cart settles. Result fed straight into `<TradeCustomerChip earnedCredit blendedRate />`.

### Verified
- 5/5 backend pytest pass (`test_epos_credit_flow.py`, `test_credit_reversal.py`, `test_refund_credit_reversal.py`, `test_credit_email_audit.py`, `test_spend_credit_flow.py`). Test suite extended to assert both no-SKU 2% fallback (£100 → £2 earned) and mixed-rate invoices (8% line + 2% line = £5 blended on £100).
- Frontend Playwright (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_130): 4/4 acceptance criteria PASS. Trade tier badges/medals still globally hidden (count=0). No regressions.

## 2026-04-29 — 🧾 Refund Notes now reverse trade credit proportionally

### What
Closed the last credit-leakage gap. When admin staff issues a Refund Note tied to a trade-customer invoice, the original credit accrual + redemption is now **proportionally** reversed. Toast surfaces the reversal in plain English.

### Proportional logic
- `ratio = min(1.0, refund.gross_total / invoice.gross_total)`
- `earned_to_reverse = invoice.trade_credit_earned × ratio` (capped at remaining un-reversed)
- `redeemed_to_refund = invoice.credit_redeemed × ratio` (capped at remaining un-reversed)
- Cumulative trackers (`credit_earned_already_reversed`, `credit_redeemed_already_reversed`) stamped on the invoice → multiple partial refunds against the same invoice never overshoot.

### Why proportional (not all-or-nothing)
A 50% partial refund on a £100 invoice with £5 earned + £50 redeemed should reverse exactly £2.50 + £25, not the full amount. The two consecutive 50% refunds together fully reverse the credit movement — same end state as a single 100% refund — but each step is fairly priced.

### Backend
- `routes/refunds.py::reverse_credits_for_refund(db, refund_dict)` — proportional reversal helper. Handles all edge cases: unattached refund (returns zeros), invoice with no credit (returns zeros), invoice already fully reversed (returns zeros), over-refunds (caps ratio at 1.0).
- `create_refund` endpoint — calls helper post-insert, stamps `credit_earned_reversed` / `credit_redeemed_refunded` / `credit_reversal_ratio` on the refund doc, returns `credits_reversed: {earned_reversed, redeemed_reversed, ratio}` to the caller.
- Writes `credit_transactions` ledger rows of new types: `reversed_earned_via_refund` / `reversed_redeemed_via_refund` with the refund_id + refund_no in the description for full audit traceability.

### Frontend
- `pages/admin/Invoice.js` (the "Process Refund" flow on a live invoice) — toast extends with *"· Trade credit: -£2.50 earned, +£25.00 redeemed refunded"* when applicable.
- `pages/admin/InvoiceHistory.js` (the "Refund" dialog from invoice list) — same toast pattern.

### Verified
- New regression `test_refund_credit_reversal.py` — 4/4 PASS:
  1. 50% refund reverses exactly 50% of credit movement
  2. Final 50% refund reverses the remaining 50% (cumulative cap respected)
  3. Over-refund attempt → returns zeros, no overshoot
  4. Unattached refund → graceful zeros
- All 7 prior regression suites still PASS — no regressions.

## 2026-04-29 — 🔔 Plain-English credit-reversal toasts on EPOS delete / restore

### What
Wired the credit-reversal summary returned by the new backend reversal helpers into 3 admin EPOS surfaces. Staff now see the financial side-effects in a 6-second toast immediately after the action, in the trader's own language ("£5.00 earned reversed, £50.00 redeemed refunded") instead of those reversals happening silently behind the scenes.

### Where toasts now show extra credit lines
1. **InvoiceHistory soft-delete** (the standard "Move to Trash" button on a live invoice):
   - Before: `Invoice deleted and stock restored`
   - After: `Invoice deleted and stock restored · Trade credit: -£5.00 earned, +£50.00 redeemed refunded`
2. **Trash → restore** (un-deleting an invoice):
   - Before: `Document restored successfully`
   - After: `Document restored successfully · Trade credit: +£5.00 earned re-applied, -£50.00 redeemed re-deducted`
3. **Trash → permanent delete**:
   - Before: `Document permanently deleted`
   - After: `Document permanently deleted · Trade credit: -£5.00 earned, +£50.00 redeemed refunded`

For non-credit-affecting invoices (no trade match, no redemption), the existing toasts render unchanged — no "Trade credit: " suffix.

### Implementation
Reused the `credits_reversed` / `credits_reapplied` summary that the 3 backend endpoints already return (verified by the 7-assertion `test_credit_reversal.py` regression). Toast duration extended to 6 seconds (default 4s) so staff actually have time to read the financial breakdown.

## 2026-04-29 — 🔁 Trade credit auto-reverses on refund / cancel / delete

User flagged a real economics gap: when an invoice/order that previously affected a trader's credit balance is undone, the credit ledger was NOT being auto-reversed. So a deleted EPOS invoice would leave the trader with credit they never really earned (and worse, redeemed credit that never came back). Fixed end-to-end across **5 trigger points**.

### Triggers wired
1. **EPOS invoice soft-deleted** (Trash) — credit reversed
2. **EPOS invoice restored from Trash** — credit re-applied (un-reversed)
3. **EPOS invoice permanently deleted** — credit reversed (handles direct perm-delete without going through Trash first)
4. **Online order status → `cancelled`** — credit reversed
5. **Online order status `cancelled` → other** — credit re-applied (handles accidentally-cancelled orders that get resurrected)

### Reversal economics
For each invalidation:
- **Credits earned** by trader: subtracted back from balance (e.g. £5 earned → -£5)
- **Credits redeemed** by trader at the till: added back to balance (e.g. £50 redeemed → +£50 refunded)

Idempotent via a `credits_reversed: true` flag stamped on the invoice/order doc — repeated triggers will NOT double-reverse. Restore unsets the flag so a subsequent delete re-runs.

### Backend
- `routes/invoices.py::reverse_invoice_credits(db, invoice, reason)` + `reapply_invoice_credits(...)` — single-source helpers for EPOS path. Atomic `$inc` against `shop_customers.credit_balance`. Writes ledger rows of types `reversed_earned_in_store` / `reversed_redeemed_in_store` / `reapplied_earned_in_store` / `reapplied_redeemed_in_store` to `credit_transactions`.
- `routes/shop.py::reverse_shop_order_credits(db, order, reason)` + `reapply_shop_order_credits(...)` — same shape for online orders. Writes to `trade_credits` collection with types `reverse_earn` / `reverse_redeem` / `reapply_earn` / `reapply_redeem`.
- All 4 endpoints now return a `credits_reversed` (or `credits_reapplied`) summary in the response so the frontend can toast the trader.
- Edge case handled: **negative balances on restore** are allowed (rather than blocking the restore) — if the customer has spent the refunded credit between cancel and un-cancel, we let the balance go negative and log it. Preferable to a stuck restore.

### Verified end-to-end
- New regression `test_credit_reversal.py` — 7/7 assertions PASS:
  1. EPOS soft-delete reverses both earned & redeemed → balance restored
  2. Restore re-applies both → balance back to post-invoice state
  3. Permanent delete reverses again → balance restored
  4. Idempotency: re-calling reverse helper returns zeros
  5. Online order cancel reverses both `credits_awarded` + `credits_applied`
  6. Online order un-cancel re-applies both
- All 6 prior regression suites still PASS — no regressions.

### Files
- `backend/routes/invoices.py` — 2 helpers + wired into `delete_invoice`, `restore_invoice`, `permanent_delete_invoice`
- `backend/routes/shop.py` — 2 helpers + wired into `update_order_status`

## 2026-04-29 — 🛑 Trade tiers FULLY hidden everywhere (master switch)

User has clearly stated trade tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum) are **not** to surface anywhere on the website until the tier programme is officially launched. Just a single flat trade discount per trader for now. Sweep complete.

### Action taken — used the existing master switch (single source of truth)
Discovered the codebase already had a `tiers_enabled` master switch wired through 4 customer-facing pages (TradeRegisterPage, TradeLoginPage, TradeAccountPage, TileStationHome). The flag was simply not set in the DB (defaulting visibly true).

**Flipped it OFF in MongoDB:**
```
db.website_settings.update({_id: 'trade_account_settings'}, {$set: {'settings.tiers_enabled': false}})
```

Verified via `GET /api/website-admin/public/trade-account-settings`:
```json
{"settings": {"tiers_enabled": false}}
```

### Effect — tier surfaces now hidden across:
1. **Trade dashboard** (`/shop/trade/account`)
   - "Your Trade Tier · Bronze" dark progress card — **hidden**
   - "Bronze Trade" sidebar pill — **hidden**
   - "X% trade discount active" purple welcome chip — already removed earlier in the day
2. **Trade login page** (`/shop/trade/login`) — tier-based messaging hidden
3. **Trade registration page** (`/shop/trade/register`) — Discount Tiers panel + tier benefit cards hidden
4. **Homepage** — right-side Trade Pricing Card hidden
5. **EPOS Invoice page** — BRONZE pill on customer chip + "Bronze -5%" in ONLINE banner + LoyaltyBadge tier medal — hardcoded hidden earlier today

### Bonus: friendly never-empty welcome banner
For brand-new traders with no balance + no orders, the welcome banner now shows a yellow-themed *"Earn credit-back on every purchase · in store and online"* placeholder pill (no tier language).

### Verified
- Smoke screenshot of `/shop/trade/account` for a brand-new trader returned `Page contains tier language: False` (regex check for /Bronze|Silver|Gold|Platinum|Trade Tier/i)
- Lint clean.

### To re-enable when tier programme launches
Single click in admin: `/admin/trade-accounts` → Settings → flip the *"Show discount tier amounts (Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum)"* master switch to ON.

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx` — restored the original `showTierCard` flag (no hardcodes; respects master switch)
- DB-side: `website_settings.trade_account_settings.settings.tiers_enabled = false`



## 2026-04-29 — 🩹 Round-2 tier label clean-up (EPOS + trade dashboard)

User flagged 4 more tier-medal-adjacent UI artefacts that needed hiding (the loyalty "Bronze Member" chip was dealt with earlier today; this pass covers the **trade tier** discount labels which they also don't want surfaced yet):

### Hidden
1. **EPOS Invoice ONLINE banner** — *"trade account T-00004 · Tonbridge - Tile Station · **Bronze -5%**"* — the trailing `Bronze -5%` segment removed. Now reads *"trade account T-00004 · Tonbridge - Tile Station."* `pages/admin/Invoice.js` line 2600 block commented out.
2. **EPOS TradeCustomerChip** — uppercase **BRONZE** pill after the T-NNNN account ref. Removed. `components/admin/TradeCustomerChip.jsx`.
3. **EPOS TradeCustomerChip** — *"5% credit-back rate"* bare-percentage text next to the balance. Hidden. The green **"Will earn £X credit on this invoice"** preview pill stays — it's the actionable, money-named version of the same info.
4. **Trade dashboard welcome banner** — *"5% trade discount active · auto-applied at checkout"* purple pill. Removed from highlights array. `pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx`.

### What's preserved
- The actual trade discount still applies on cart pricing (no functional change)
- Credit-back is still accrued on every qualifying invoice (assuming the master toggle is ON)
- The earned-credit preview pill on the EPOS chip still renders ("Will earn £14.50 credit on this invoice")
- Only the *cosmetic tier labels* and the *bare percentage chips* are hidden

All blocks are commented (not deleted) so the tier programme can be brought back in one-line edits when the user is ready.

## 2026-04-29 — 🔑 Forgot-password page now pre-fills the email from `?email=`

### What
When a customer clicks the **"Forgot password?"** link on `/shop/tile-login` or `/shop/trade/login` (which goes amber + pulsing after 2 wrong attempts thanks to earlier work today), the email they typed into the login form is now carried through as a `?email=...` query param and **pre-fills** the email field on the password-reset page. They click **Send Reset Link** straight away — no retyping.

### Bonus catch (broken link fix)
The two login pages were already passing `?email=` in their links to `/shop/tile-forgot-password` — but that route was never registered in `App.js`, so the link silently 404'd in production. Added the route alias (mounts the same `ForgotPassword` component on both `/forgot-password` and `/shop/tile-forgot-password`).

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/ForgotPassword.js` — `useEffect` reads `?email=` from the URL and seeds the input.
- `frontend/src/App.js` — added `/shop/tile-forgot-password` route alias.

### Verified
Smoke screenshot of `/shop/tile-forgot-password?email=trader%40example.com` shows the email field pre-filled with `trader@example.com`. Both files lint clean.



## 2026-04-29 — 🩹 Two quick launch-day patches: hide tier medals + fix toggle deep-link

### 1) Hidden Tier Medals (Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum) on EPOS Invoice
The user reported the loyalty-tier medal badge ("Bronze Member · 0 points") rendering on every EPOS invoice was premature — they don't want that programme live yet. Hidden everywhere it surfaces:
- `pages/admin/Invoice.js` — `<LoyaltyBadge>` usage commented out + import commented out (preserves both for one-line re-enable when loyalty programme actually launches)
- The `LoyaltyDashboard` admin page itself is left intact at `/admin/loyalty` (not surfaced in sidebar, only reachable by direct URL — so it doesn't bleed into customer-facing flows).
- EPOS Invoice now shows just Name / Phone / Email / Address / Notes — no medals.

### 2) Fixed broken "Turn on" deep-link in TradeCustomerChip OFF warning
The rose warning chip on the EPOS invoice ("Credit-back accrual is currently OFF store-wide") had a "Turn on" link pointing to `/admin/storefront-messages` — that route doesn't exist. The actual toggle lives on `/admin/storefront-features` (the *In-store trade credit · Accrue trade credit on EPOS invoices* card).
- Updated `components/admin/TradeCustomerChip.jsx` to point to the correct route.
- Verified the toggle is reachable, labelled correctly, and the screenshot now shows the toggle.

### Verified
- Smoke screenshot of `/admin/invoice` confirms the medal is gone.
- Smoke screenshot of `/admin/storefront-features` confirms the in-store credit toggle exists with correct labelling.
- Both files lint clean.

## 2026-04-29 — 🪙 "Discount Balance" pill on shop customer dashboard

### What
Regular (non-trade) shop customers with a positive `credit_balance` (typically loyalty / refund credit) now see an **emerald Discount Balance pill** at the top of their dashboard at `/shop/account` — same one-click *"Spend at checkout →"* CTA the trade dashboard already had. Click → cart → checkout, where the credit auto-applies.

Renders only when:
- `is_trade` is **false** (trade users get their own dedicated card on `/shop/trade/account` — no duplicate UI)
- `credit_balance` is strictly **> £0** — silent for £0 balances

### Backend
- `routes/shop.py::redeem_trade_credits` — relaxed the gate. Was: *"only trade customers can redeem"*. Now: *"any logged-in customer with positive credit_balance can redeem"*. The endpoint still preserves all existing behaviour (atomic deduction, ledger entry, order total update, 400 on insufficient balance, 404 on paid order).

### Frontend
- `pages/shop/TileAccountPage.js` — emerald gradient card mounted above Account Details, hidden for trade users and zero balances. Reuses the same `tile_use_trade_credit` sessionStorage signalling pattern.
- `pages/shop/TileCheckoutPage.js` — auto-apply effect now allows ANY logged-in customer with positive balance (was trade-only). Comment block updated to call out the relaxed rule.

### Verified
- New regression `test_shop_customer_credit.py`:
  1. Non-trade w/£20 balance redeems £15 → `new_balance=£5`, `new_total=£85` (was 403 before this change)
  2. Non-trade w/£0 balance → 400 *"No credit available to redeem"*
- All prior regression suites still PASS — no regressions.

## 2026-04-29 — 📤 "Send to trader now" button inside the statement preview modal

### What
Tiny green **"Send to trader now"** button in the footer of the statement preview modal. When a trader rings asking *"can you email me my March statement?"* and you've just walked through it on screen, you can ping it to their inbox with one click instead of waiting for the 1st-of-month batch.

### Backend
- New endpoint: `POST /api/admin/trade-credit/statements/send-one` (admin-only)
  - Body: `{email, year?, month?}` (defaults to previous calendar month)
  - Looks up customer by email; rejects non-trade (404) / unknown email (404)
  - Builds the statement; rejects months with no movement (400 with friendly *"No credit movement in March 2026 — nothing to send"*)
  - Dispatches via the existing `_send_one_statement()` helper (502 on Resend failure)
  - Writes an audit row to `credit_statement_sends` collection: `{customer_email, period, summary, sent_by, sent_at, trigger: 'admin_on_demand'}` so we have an audit trail of off-cron sends

### Frontend
- `components/admin/CreditStatementPreviewButton.jsx` — added emerald **Send to trader now** button to the modal footer (alongside the period summary chips). Confirms before sending. Loader during dispatch. Toast on success/failure. Reuses the open period selector — sends whatever month is currently being previewed. Disabled when no movement (button doesn't render at all on no-movement months).

### Verified
- 5/5 backend regression assertions PASS (`test_send_one_statement.py`):
  1. Valid trade w/movement → 200, real Resend dispatch confirmed
  2. Trade with no movement in window → 400
  3. Non-trade customer → 404
  4. Unknown email → 404
  5. Audit row written with `trigger='admin_on_demand'` + `sent_by`
- Both files lint clean.

## 2026-04-29 — 📄 Admin "View Statement" preview modal on Trade Accounts

### What
Tiny green file-icon button on every row of `/admin/trade-accounts` (between Edit and Delete). Click → modal opens preview of that trader's monthly credit statement HTML rendered in an iframe — exactly what the trader received (or would receive) for that calendar month. Defaults to last full calendar month, with ◀▶ arrows to walk back through prior months.

**Use case**: trader rings the showroom asking *"what did I earn last month?"* — staff can answer in 2 seconds without digging through the ledger.

### Frontend
- `components/admin/CreditStatementPreviewButton.jsx` — NEW. Button + modal pair. Modal includes:
  - Header: business name + email + month selector with prev/next arrows
  - Iframe rendering the actual email HTML returned by `/api/admin/trade-credit/statements/preview`
  - Friendly empty-state for no-movement months: *"No credit movement in {Month} — no statement would be sent for this month"*
  - Footer summary chips: 📅 period · `+£X earned` · `–£X redeemed` · `£X closing balance` · `N transactions`
  - Disabled "next month" arrow when at current month (can't preview a future statement)
- `pages/admin/TradeAccounts.js` — mounted between Edit and Delete buttons, only when the row has a `contact_email`.

### Verified
- Frontend smoke screenshot confirmed: button renders, modal opens, iframe shows the full email body with hero, summary block, earned/redeemed tables, CTA, footer chips with all key strings (£62.50, £40.00, £22.50, 2 transactions). Both files lint clean.
- No backend changes — reuses the `/api/admin/trade-credit/statements/preview` endpoint shipped earlier today.

### Files
- `frontend/src/components/admin/CreditStatementPreviewButton.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/TradeAccounts.js`



## 2026-04-29 — 📅 Monthly trade-credit statement email (1st of month)

### What
A quiet, bank-statement-style email that goes out on the **1st of each month at 10:00 UTC** to trade customers WHO HAD CREDIT MOVEMENT IN THE MONTH JUST CLOSED. Builds the ritual that the trader has an **asset** with us — even in months they didn't buy. Skips silently for traders with no movement (no spam).

**Email contents:**
- Branded header: *"Tile Station · Trade Credit Statement — March 2026"*
- Greeting: *"Hi {first_name}, here's your trade-credit statement for **March 2026** on account T-NNNN."*
- Bank-style summary block: **+ £62.50 earned** / **– £40.00 redeemed** / **Closing balance £22.50**
- Recent activity tables (max 5 each side): date, ref (`INV-A` / `TS-1`), amount, with green/rose accents
- Big dark CTA: **View my trade account →** (only when balance > 0)
- Polite footer: *"Statements arrive on the 1st of each month, and only when there's been activity."*

### Architecture
- New module: `routes/trade_credit_statements.py`
  - `_build_customer_statement(db, customer, year, month)` — aggregates `credit_transactions` (`earned_*` / `redeemed_*` / `redeem`) for the given calendar month. Returns `None` for zero-movement so the caller can skip cleanly.
  - `render_monthly_statement_html(stmt)` — pure renderer, no DB/network.
  - `_send_one_statement(stmt)` — Resend dispatch. Returns `{sent, error}`.
  - `dispatch_monthly_statements(db, year, month, dry_run, limit)` — the workhorse. Batched 50-at-a-time customer iteration. Uses `credit_transactions.distinct(customer_id)` to skip dormant accounts entirely.
  - `run_monthly_credit_statements_tick()` — hourly probe; fires only on day=1 at hour=10 UTC, idempotent via `website_settings.monthly_credit_statements.last_period`.
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/admin/trade-credit/statements/send-monthly` — manual re-run (admin-only). Body: `{year, month, dry_run, limit, force}`. Returns counts. 409 if already dispatched without `force=true`.
  - `GET  /api/admin/trade-credit/statements/preview?email=...&year=&month=` — single-customer preview HTML for QA / customer-service "what did they get?" inspection.
  - `GET  /api/admin/trade-credit/statements/last-run` — read the marker doc.
- Scheduler hook: `services/scheduler.py` adds `monthly_credit_statements` cron job (hourly probe, `minute=15`, idempotent + misfire grace 600s).

### Verified
- 5/5 unit assertions PASS (`test_monthly_credit_statement.py`):
  1. Customer with 2 earnings + 1 redemption → totals + balance + HTML strings correct
  2. Customer with no movement → `_build_customer_statement` returns `None`
  3. `dispatch_monthly_statements` dry_run counts `eligible/sent/skipped` correctly
  4. `/preview` endpoint returns HTML for movement, "no movement" for quiet account
  5. `/send-monthly` dry_run returns counts without persisting marker
- E2E PASS (`test_monthly_credit_statement_e2e.py`): real Resend dispatch returned `{sent: true, error: null}` for a seeded customer with £62.50 earned + £40 redeemed = £22.50 balance.
- All 4 prior regression suites still PASS — no regressions.

## 2026-04-29 — 💷 Personalised "You have £X credit ready to spend" banner in trader emails

### What
Every transactional email a trade customer receives — order confirmation, processing, ready for collection, shipped, delivered, collected, cancelled — now opens with a personalised emerald banner showing their **current** trade-credit balance and a direct "Spend now →" CTA back to the dashboard. Top-of-inbox placement of the trader's own balance turns every routine email into a passive redemption nudge.

### Strict gating per user request
Banner renders **only** when:
- The recipient is a registered trade customer (`is_trade=True`)
- Their `credit_balance` is strictly **> £0**

For everyone else (trade with £0, ordinary shoppers, unrecognised emails, missing customer record, DB error) the helper returns an empty string — never any awkward placeholder, never a £0 banner, never a "spend nothing" CTA.

### Backend
- `services/email.py::_render_trade_credit_balance_banner_html(customer_email)` — async helper. Looks up the customer by lowercased email, returns banner HTML or `""`.
- `generate_order_status_email_html()` — added `trade_credit_banner_html: str = ""` kwarg, injected at the very top of the `<!-- Content -->` block (above the headline).
- `send_order_status_notification()` — pre-fetches the banner once and threads it through. Used by `send_shop_order_confirmation` and any explicit status update.
- `send_shop_order_status_email()` — alternative status-update path (templated). Same banner injection.

### Verified
- 5/5 unit assertions PASS (`/app/backend/tests/test_trade_credit_banner.py`):
  1. Trade w/£87.50 → banner rendered with "£87.50", "Spend now", account ref
  2. Trade w/£0.00 → empty
  3. Non-trade w/credit_balance field → empty
  4. Unknown email → empty
  5. None / "" email → empty
- E2E PASS (`/app/backend/tests/test_trade_credit_banner_e2e.py`): real Resend dispatch returned 200 (`email_id: b06ca906-...`) AND the rendered HTML contains "£42.75" + "Spend now".
- All 3 prior regression suites still PASS (epos credit flow, credit email audit, spend credit flow). No regressions.

## 2026-04-29 — 🛒 "Spend my credit at checkout" one-click trader CTA

### What
A green **"Spend my credit at checkout →"** button on the trader's online dashboard credit-balance card converts that previously-static balance pill into a real call-to-action. One click jumps straight to the cart, and the checkout page auto-applies the full balance (capped at order total) as a deduction line in the Order Summary.

### How it flows
1. **Dashboard** (`/shop/trade/account`) — emerald CTA button on the Available Discount Balance card. Hidden when balance is £0. Click → sets `sessionStorage.tile_use_trade_credit = '1'` and navigates to `/shop/tile-cart`.
2. **Checkout** (`/shop/tile-checkout`) — on mount, reads the flag + the cached `tile_shop_customer.credit_balance`, and if the user is logged-in trade with positive balance, auto-enables redemption. Renders an emerald row in the Order Summary: *"Trade credit applied (£2.08 left for next order) – £197.92 [remove]"* with a working remove button.
3. **Submit** — between order creation and Stripe payment, calls `POST /api/shop/trade/credits/redeem` with the order_id + amount. Backend atomically deducts from `shop_customers.credit_balance`, updates `shop_orders.total`, stamps `credits_applied` + `original_total`, and inserts a `trade_credits` ledger entry. The reduced order.total is then read by the existing `/guest-checkout/pay` endpoint when minting the Stripe session, so the customer pays the correct (post-credit) amount.
4. **Cache refresh** — on successful redeem, the cached customer balance in localStorage is updated and a `trade-auth-change` event fires so the dashboard pill refreshes on next visit.
5. **Defensive fallback** — if Stripe redeem fails for any reason, we abort BEFORE redirecting to Stripe (the order itself lingers as unpaid for retry).

### React strict-mode gotcha (debugged & fixed)
The first implementation removed the `tile_use_trade_credit` sessionStorage flag inside the mount-effect. React 18 strict-mode dev double-mounts components, and the second mount found the flag gone → `tradeCreditEnabled` reset to its initial `false`. Fix: only clear the flag on (a) successful redemption or (b) explicit user "remove" click — never inside the auto-apply effect.

### Backend
- No new endpoints — reused existing `POST /api/shop/trade/credits/redeem` which already handles atomic deduction + ledger entry + order total update.
- Added regression test `/app/backend/tests/test_spend_credit_flow.py` — 4 assertions: redeem £80 of £100 balance against £250 order → balance £20 / order £170 / credits_applied £80 / new total £170; over-redemption returns 400; already-paid order returns 404. All PASS.

### Frontend
- `pages/shop/TradeAccountPage.jsx` — emerald CTA button on credit-balance card.
- `pages/shop/TileCheckoutPage.js` — `tradeCreditEnabled`/`tradeCreditBalance` state, useEffect auto-apply, `tradeCreditApplied` derived (capped at `totalBeforeCredit`), updated `total` calc, emerald row in Order Summary, redeem call between order creation and Stripe payment, balance-cache refresh on success.

### Verified
- Backend regression: 4/4 PASS.
- Frontend smoke screenshot: row renders correctly with `(£2.08 left for next order)` micro-copy, total drops from £197.92 → £0.00, working remove button.
- Lint clean (both files).

## 2026-04-29 — 📬 "Trade Credit Emails — recent dispatches" admin audit log

### What
Compact card on `/admin/sales-hub` (above the regular hub cards, between Daily Reconciliation and Essentials Needing Photos) showing the last 20 EPOS invoices that fired the "you earned £X credit" trade re-engagement email. Auto-hides when no email has fired yet (zero-state friendly).

**Each row shows:** invoice no, business + email + T-NNNN, credit earned + rate, ✅ **Sent** / ❌ **Failed** chip (with error text for failures), relative timestamp ("2m ago"), and a one-click **Re-send** button on every failed row (rose outline) for instant recovery from Resend blips.

**Header:** *"Last N: X sent · Y failed"* — at-a-glance health summary. Refresh button top-right.

### Backend
- `routes/invoices.py::list_credit_emails` — `GET /api/invoices/credit-emails/recent?limit=20`. Reads invoices with `credit_email_at` set, sorts newest-first, capped 1-100. Returns `{rows, total, sent_count, failed_count}`. EPOS-access required.
- `routes/invoices.py::resend_credit_email` — `POST /api/invoices/{id}/credit-emails/resend`. Re-fires the celebratory email via the existing `send_trade_credit_earned_email()` helper, **never touches the credit ledger** (only re-runs the email, not accrual). Uses the trader's CURRENT balance for the email body (more accurate than the historical `balance_after`). Falls back to invoice-stamped trade fields if the customer record was deleted/renamed. Stamps invoice with `credit_email_resent_by` for audit. 400 on no-credit invoices, 404 on bogus IDs.

### Frontend
- `components/admin/RecentCreditEmailsCard.jsx` — NEW. Polls on mount, refresh button, confirm dialog before re-send, optimistic toast feedback, auto-reload after re-send.
- `pages/admin/SalesHub.js` — mounted between DailyReconciliation and Essentials cards.

### Verified end-to-end
- New regression test `/app/backend/tests/test_credit_email_audit.py` — 4/4 PASS:
  1. Listing returns the right `sent_count` / `failed_count` and rows
  2. Re-send on a failed entry returns `{ok: true}`, real Resend dispatch worked, doc stamped with `credit_email_resent_by`
  3. Re-send on no-credit invoice → 400
  4. Re-send on bogus ID → 404
- Frontend smoke screenshot confirmed card renders correctly with both ✅ Sent and ❌ Failed states + working Re-send button. Lint clean across all 3 files.

## 2026-04-29 — 💌 "You just earned £X trade credit at {showroom}!" email

### What
Every in-store EPOS invoice that accrues credit-back for a trade customer now auto-sends a branded re-engagement email via Resend — the in-store analogue of the online order-confirmation email.

**Email contents:**
- Emerald-gradient hero: *"You just earned £14.50 credit at Chingford, thanks Smith!"* (uses stripped first word of business name so LTD/Limited suffixes aren't shouted at the customer)
- Breakdown card: invoice total, credit-back rate (e.g. *"5.0% of £290.00 net"*), **Credit earned today: +£14.50**, **New balance: £205.00**
- Big dark CTA: **View my trade account →** deep-links to `/shop/trade/account`
- Polite reminder they can redeem the credit in-store (by quoting their T-NNNNN) or online (at checkout)
- Branded footer with company details and reply-to set to the showroom email so responses land in the right inbox

### Backend
- `services/email.py::send_trade_credit_earned_email(invoice, trade_customer, credits_earned, balance_after)` — async Resend helper. Returns `{sent: bool, error: str|None}` so the caller can log delivery status. Idempotent — never raises; transient Resend errors are swallowed + logged.
- `services/__init__.py` — re-export.
- `routes/invoices.py` accrual block — after the `earned_in_store` credit_transaction insert, fires the email and stamps the invoice with `credit_email_sent`, `credit_email_error`, `credit_email_at` for audit/debug. Never aborts the invoice save even if email fails.

### Verified
`/app/backend/tests/test_epos_credit_flow.py` extended with an assertion for `credit_email_sent`. 6/6 assertions PASS — Resend returned 200 and the flag is stamped to `True` on the invoice. Lint clean.

## 2026-04-29 — 💷 EPOS Trader Credit Visibility & "Pay with Trade Credit"

### Reported
After clocking in a trade customer at the till, staff couldn't see (1) any way to apply trade credit as part/full payment and (2) how much credit the trader would earn from the current invoice.

### What
1. **Earned-credit live preview** in `TradeCustomerChip` — emerald pill *"Will earn £14.50 credit on this invoice (5% of £290 net)"* updates as line items change. Computed exactly the same way the backend mirror at invoice save (`subtotal × credit_rate / 100`). Renders only when `in_store_credit.enabled` master toggle is ON. `data-testid="epos-earned-credit-preview"`.
2. **OFF-toggle warning** in the same chip — rose `AlertTriangle` card when accrual is store-wide OFF: *"Credit-back accrual is currently OFF store-wide — no credit will be earned on this invoice. Turn on →"* with a deep-link to `/admin/storefront-messages`. `data-testid="epos-credit-accrual-off"`. Defensive: stays null/hidden on a transient network blip so a brief failure of `/api/storefront-messages/public` doesn't flash a misleading OFF warning.
3. **Dedicated "Pay with Trade Credit" card** (`InvoiceCreditPaymentCard.js`) — emerald gradient panel positioned BELOW the InvoicePrintPreview and ABOVE the Payments Received deposits section. Renders only when a trade match has positive balance. Inputs: amount field, *Apply max* button (capped at min(balance, gross_total)), *Clear* button (when applied > 0), and a live "Will deduct £X from T-NNNN. Remaining: £Y" footer. `data-testid="epos-credit-payment-card"`.
4. **Deposits summary clarity** — when credit is redeemed, the existing "Total Received" card now also shows `+ £X.XX trade credit` subtext so staff sees the full money flow at a glance. `data-testid="deposits-credit-applied-line"`.
5. **Outstanding-amount fix (frontend + backend)** — both `calculateTotals()` and the backend invoice creation now correctly subtract `credit_redeemed_amount` from `amount_outstanding`. Previously `gross_total - deposits` only — a £100 invoice paid via £50 cash + £50 credit incorrectly showed £50 outstanding. Now reads £0.

### Backend
- `routes/invoices.py:642-664` — `total_paid = total_deposits + credit_redeemed_for_calc` (only when `credit_redeemed_account` is also set, so spurious zeros don't bypass the deposits gate). `amount_outstanding` and the `deposit_order` vs `open_order` status now reflect credit payments correctly.
- Atomic redemption (already present) verified end-to-end: `find_one_and_update({credit_balance: $gte: amount}, $inc: -amount)` with `return_document=BEFORE`. Over-redemption returns HTTP 400.

### Frontend
- `components/admin/TradeCustomerChip.jsx` — added `netSubtotal` prop, in_store_credit toggle fetch, earned-credit preview pill, OFF-warning card.
- `components/invoice/InvoiceCreditPaymentCard.js` — NEW.
- `components/invoice/index.js` — re-export.
- `components/invoice/InvoiceDepositsSection.js` — `+ £X trade credit` subtext under Total Received.
- `pages/admin/Invoice.js` — pass `netSubtotal={totals.totalDue}` to chip; mount `InvoiceCreditPaymentCard` above deposits; `calculateTotals()` now returns `creditRedeemed` and includes it in the outstanding calc.

### Verified end-to-end
- Backend regression: `/app/backend/tests/test_epos_credit_flow.py` 5/5 assertions PASS — invoice creation deducts atomically, accrues at correct rate, stamps invoice with both credit fields, status flips to `deposit_order`, outstanding = gross - deposits - credit, over-redemption returns 400.
- Frontend Playwright (testing_agent_v3_fork, iteration_129): 7/7 PASS — chip renders, earned-preview pill renders with correct £, rose OFF-warning renders when toggle off, payment card renders with input + Apply max + Clear, deposits subtext renders when credit applied, outstanding correctly reduced.
- All 5 touched files lint clean (Python ruff + JS ESLint).

## 2026-04-29 — ✨ Subtle "Forgot password?" amber nudge after 2 wrong attempts

### What
Both retail (`TileLoginPage.js`) and trade (`TradeLoginPage.jsx`) login pages now track a `wrongPasswordStreak` counter. When the user hits 2+ consecutive wrong passwords with the SAME email AND that email is registered, the existing "Forgot password?" link:
- changes from grey/black to amber
- becomes underlined + bold
- pulses gently (`animate-pulse`)

The visual change is subtle but unmistakable — it nudges users who clearly know their email but keep typing the wrong password toward the reset flow rather than giving up. The link also now passes `?email=` to the forgot-password page so the customer doesn't have to retype it.

### Reset conditions
- Successful login → reset to 0
- User edits the email field → reset to 0 (different email = different test, fair start)
- "No account found" path doesn't bump the streak (handled by the existing register-instead hint)

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TileLoginPage.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeLoginPage.jsx`

### Verified
Both files lint clean. No backend changes — pure component-state counter so it's zero-risk.


## 2026-04-29 — ✨ "No account found — Register instead →" inline hint on login pages

### What
Mirror image of the register-page hint built earlier today. When a customer types an email + password and clicks Sign In, if the credentials fail, the frontend does ONE rate-limited check ("does this email exist?") and shows a contextual amber hint:
- `No account found for this email. Register instead →` (retail) — links to `/shop/register?email=...`
- `No trade account found for this email. Register instead →` (trade) — links to `/shop/trade/register?email=...`

The destination register page **pre-fills the email field** from `?email=`, so the customer just types the rest of their details. Two extra clicks instead of seven.

### Backend security trade-off
Account-enumeration risk acknowledged and mitigated:
- New `POST /api/shop/auth/email-exists` returns `{exists: bool}` for a single email.
- **Rate-limited 8 calls / 30s per IP** (in-memory token bucket; reads `X-Forwarded-For` so it works behind the kube ingress).
- When rate-limited, returns `{exists: true, rate_limited: true}` — quietly tells an attacker every email "exists" so the throttled endpoint is useless for enumeration.
- Login itself still returns the generic "Invalid email or password" — the frontend only invokes the exists-check AFTER login fails, so legitimate UX gets one round-trip per failure, not per-keystroke.

### Files
- `backend/routes/shop.py` — new endpoint + per-IP rate limiter
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TileLoginPage.js` — exists-check on failed login + hint UI + clear-on-edit
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeLoginPage.jsx` — same pattern
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/CustomerRegisterPage.jsx` — pre-fill `email` from `?email=` query param
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeRegisterPage.jsx` — pre-fill `email` from `?email=` query param

### Verified live (4/4)
1. Existing email → `{exists:true}` ✅
2. Non-existent email → `{exists:false}` ✅
3. Malformed input (no @, missing field) → safe `{exists:false}` ✅
4. 9th call within 30s → `{exists:true, rate_limited:true}` (correctly fails closed) ✅

All 5 touched files lint clean.


## 2026-04-29 — ✨ "Already registered? Sign in instead →" inline hint

### What
When the backend returns `Email already registered` on either trade or retail registration, the form now flips an `emailAlreadyRegistered` state which:
- highlights the email field with an amber border
- shows a small amber hint card directly below the input: *"This email is already registered. Sign in instead →"*
- the link goes to the matching login page with the email pre-filled via `?email=` query param (so the customer just types their password and goes)
- clears the moment the customer edits the email

### Bonus polish
- `TileLoginPage.js` and `TradeLoginPage.jsx` now read `?email=` and pre-fill the email field on mount. So the journey is: type email → submit → see "already registered" → click "Sign in instead" → email is already there → type password → done. **Two extra clicks instead of seven.**

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeRegisterPage.jsx` — state, handleChange clearing, error path detection, inline hint UI
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/CustomerRegisterPage.jsx` — same pattern
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TileLoginPage.js` — read `?email=` from URL
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeLoginPage.jsx` — read `?email=` from URL

### Verified
All 4 files lint clean. Trigger condition is the exact backend message ("Email already registered") matched case-insensitively, so any future error rephrasing won't silently break the feature.


## 2026-04-29 — 🐛 BUGFIX (Issue #13): "Registration failed" toast hid the actual reason

### Reported
User screenshot showed a generic "Registration failed" toast on the trade registration page with no explanation of WHY it failed.

### Root cause
Both `TradeRegisterPage.jsx` and `CustomerRegisterPage.jsx` were doing:
```js
if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Registration failed');
```
The backend was correctly returning `{"detail": "Email already registered"}` (400) or a Pydantic validation array (422), but the frontend completely ignored the response body and showed a useless generic message. So the user had no way to know whether their email was already taken, their postcode was wrong, their email format was invalid, etc.

Additional finding: the trade form's `confirmPassword` field was being sent to the backend, where the Pydantic `TradeCustomerRegister` model doesn't accept it. Pydantic's default behaviour (ignore extra fields) prevented this from being a hard 422, but it's cleaner not to send it.

### Fix
Both pages now read `response.json()` on failure and surface the backend's error message. Three distinct paths handled:
- **400 (string detail)** → toast shows the exact backend message, e.g. *"Email already registered"*
- **422 (Pydantic detail array)** → toast shows the first validation error formatted as `field: message`, e.g. *"email: value is not a valid email address: An email address must have an @-sign."*
- **Non-JSON / network failure** → graceful fallback to a friendly default

Trade form now also strips `confirmPassword` from the request body. The existing in-form `validate()` already checks the match, so behaviour is unchanged.

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/TradeRegisterPage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/CustomerRegisterPage.jsx`

### Verified live
1. Duplicate email → backend `{"detail":"Email already registered"}` → toast displays the exact text ✅
2. Invalid email format → backend 422 with `loc:["body","email"]` → toast displays `email: value is not a valid email address...` ✅
3. Both files lint clean.

### What this means for the user
Whatever caused the original "Registration failed" in your screenshot will now show the real reason. Most likely it was either a duplicate email (someone had already registered), or a missing required field. If you can reproduce the failure with the new build, the toast will tell you exactly what's wrong.


## 2026-04-29 — 🎚️ Trade Tiers visibility: master switch promoted + label clarified

### Why
User couldn't find where to hide the "Discount Tiers" panel on the trade registration page. The toggle existed but was buried inside the "Pricing" tab labeled "Trade Pricing Card" — that label hid the fact that the same switch ALSO controls 4 other places in the shop.

### What
- **Promoted** — large visibility card now sits at the top of `/admin/trade-account-settings`, above the tabs. Green bg when visible, amber when hidden, with a "Master switch" badge so admin can't miss it.
- **Renamed + documented** — label is now *"Show discount tier amounts (Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum)"* with a "Save to apply" hint. Collapsible `<details>` lists all 5 affected pages so anyone touching it understands the blast radius:
  1. Trade registration page — Discount Tiers panel
  2. Trade registration page — auto-hides any benefit card mentioning Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum/"Tier"
  3. Trade login page — tier-based messaging
  4. Trade account dashboard — tier indicators
  5. Homepage — right-side Trade Pricing Card
- **Old toggle deduped** — the in-tab toggle on the "Pricing" tab now shows a read-only "Visible/Hidden (master)" pill pointing to the master switch, eliminating the two-controls-for-one-state confusion.

### Files
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/TradeAccountSettings.jsx`

### Verified
- Lint clean.
- Backend wiring unchanged — same `tiers_enabled` field on `website_settings`. Confirmed via API.


## 2026-04-29 — 🏷️ Opt-in "Apply trade pricing" button (super-admin gated, hidden by default)

### Built per user spec
- **Option (b)**: opt-in button (NOT auto-apply). Staff has full control.
- **Hidden by default**: gated behind a super-admin-only feature flag stored in `website_settings._id="epos_feature_flags"`. Default value `false` so the button is invisible in production until the user explicitly enables it.
- **Manageable**: super-admin toggles it from Trade Accounts → EPOS Settings panel.

### Backend
- `routes/customers.py`:
  - `EPOS_FEATURE_FLAGS_DEFAULTS` whitelist (currently 1 key: `trade_pricing_apply_button`). Hardcoded so unknown keys are rejected.
  - `GET /api/customers/epos-feature-flags` — returns merged defaults + persisted overrides. EPOS-access required.
  - `PUT /api/customers/epos-feature-flags` — super-admin only. Coerces values to bool, drops unknown keys, returns the merged map.

### Frontend
- `lib/api.js` — new `getEposFeatureFlags()` and `updateEposFeatureFlags(flags)`.
- `pages/admin/TradeAccounts.js` — new "EPOS Settings" card visible only when `user.role === 'super_admin'`. Renders a labelled iOS-style switch per flag with explanatory subtext + "Super Admin" amber badge in the panel header. Optimistic UI with rollback on failure.
- `pages/admin/Invoice.js`:
  - Fetches the flag map on mount.
  - When linking an online customer, also captures `linkedTradeTier` and `linkedTradeDiscount`.
  - Linked-online-account chip now shows the trade tier badge inline (e.g. *"Silver -10%"*) when present.
  - **Apply trade pricing button** appears in the chip ONLY when ALL of: flag ON, customer is linked, customer has `trade_discount > 0`, and at least one line item has a `productId`. On click: sets `due_price = price * (1 - pct/100)` per line, respects per-product `max_discount` cap (clearance items can't go below their floor), stamps `trade_discount_applied` per line, shows a toast with how many lines updated and how many were capped.

### Verified live
1. `GET /epos-feature-flags` default → `{trade_pricing_apply_button: false}` ✅
2. `PUT` as super-admin → toggles ON ✅
3. Re-`GET` → reflects new state ✅
4. `PUT` with bogus key → 400 "No valid flag keys supplied" ✅
5. Toggled back OFF → as requested, the flag is OFF in production. The button stays invisible. ✅
6. Lint clean (Python + JSX).

### How to use (when ready)
1. Log in as super_admin → `/admin/trade-accounts`
2. Top of page now shows **"EPOS Settings — Super Admin"** card
3. Flip the **"Apply trade pricing button on Invoice"** switch ON
4. The button appears next to any linked-online-account chip in the Invoice screen for trade customers with a discount %
5. Click it on an actual invoice → it batches the trade discount across all line items, with a single audit-friendly toast confirming what was applied (and what was capped by per-product limits)
6. Flip it OFF any time to hide everything again — your data is unchanged, only the button visibility toggles


## 2026-04-29 — 🔗 Unified Customer System: Online ↔ In-Store (Option D)

### Why
A trade customer who registered through `tilestation.co.uk` was invisible in the EPOS Invoice's customer search — that search only read from `db.users` (staff-managed) but online registrations live in `db.shop_customers`. When they walked in to pay, staff had to manually retype everything, the trade pricing wasn't carried over, and the in-store invoice never appeared in the customer's online order history. Option D fixes all three problems at once.

### Backend
- **`routes/customers.py::unified_customer_search`** — new `GET /api/customers/unified-search?q=...` endpoint. Searches **both** `users` AND `shop_customers` collections in parallel, dedupes by email (case-insensitive), surfaces trade fields (`trade_account_number`, `business_name`, `is_trade`, `credit_balance`, `credit_rate`, `trade_tier`, `trade_discount`). Each result has a `source` field: `'users'`, `'shop'`, or `'users+shop'` so the UI can show a 🌐 Online chip when relevant. Permission-gated to admin or `epos` permission.
- **`routes/invoices.py::InvoiceCreate`** — added three new optional fields: `linked_shop_customer_id`, `linked_trade_account_number`, `linked_business_name`. The create handler stamps them onto the invoice doc and auto-backfills the trade fields from `shop_customers` if the staff member only set the link.
- **`routes/shop.py::get_shop_orders`** — extended to ALSO return any `invoices` linked to the shop customer's `id`. Mapped onto the same shape the existing `ShopOrders.js` expects, with `source: 'in_store'` so the frontend can show an "In-store" pill. Status: `delivered` when fully paid, else `processing`.

### Frontend
- **`lib/api.js`** — new `unifiedCustomerSearch(q, limit)` method.
- **`components/CustomerDetailsSection.js`** — `fetchSuggestions` now fires the legacy email-suggestions lookup AND the new unified-search in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`. Merged & de-duped results carry `_is_online` / `_is_trade` flags. Suggestion rows render 🌐 Online and 🏷️ Trade · T-NNNNN chips above the existing name/phone/email/address grid. Selecting an online customer automatically forwards `shop_customer_id`, `trade_account_number`, `business_name` to the parent.
- **`pages/admin/Invoice.js`** — `onSelectCustomer` now captures `linkedShopCustomerId`, `linkedTradeAccountNumber`, `linkedBusinessName` into invoice state. Sky-blue chip "🌐 Online · This invoice will appear in [name]'s online order history · trade account T-NNNNN" appears under Customer Details when linked, with an "Unlink" button. Saved invoice payload now carries the three link fields. `resetForm` clears them on new invoice.
- **`pages/shop/ShopOrders.js`** — orange "🏪 In-store" pill on in-store invoices in the customer's "My Orders" page. Different placed-on language ("Issued at" vs "Placed on"), shows the showroom name, hides the chevron-detail button (in-store invoices aren't viewable through the online order detail route — replaced with a "Receipt" label and tooltip directing the customer to contact their local showroom for amendments).

### Verified end-to-end
1. Existing trade customer in `shop_customers` (email `whatsapp-test-1774739571@example.com`, business "Smith Builders Ltd") found by `GET /api/customers/unified-search?q=Smith` with `source: 'shop'`, `is_trade: true` ✅
2. Created invoice with `linked_shop_customer_id` + payment method → DB shows `linked_shop_customer_id: '288a0...'`, `trade_business_name: 'Smith Builders Ltd'` auto-pulled from shop_customers ✅
3. Logged in as shop customer → `GET /api/shop/orders` returned the in-store invoice with `source: 'in_store'`, status `delivered`, gross `£180` ✅
4. All 3 backend files + 3 frontend files lint clean (the 7 pre-existing shop.py issues are unrelated to this work).

### Files changed
- `backend/routes/customers.py` — new unified-search endpoint
- `backend/routes/invoices.py` — InvoiceCreate model + invoice_dict stamping
- `backend/routes/shop.py` — get_shop_orders now merges in-store invoices
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` — new method
- `frontend/src/components/CustomerDetailsSection.js` — parallel search + chips
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Invoice.js` — link state + visual indicator + payload
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/ShopOrders.js` — In-store pill + receipt label


## 2026-04-29 — 🟢 Health dot in Live Visitors header

### What
Tiny pill indicator next to the "Live visitors" panel title showing data-integrity status:
- **Green** with `N visible` when count == list length, OR when count > 50 and list is capped at 50 (expected for heavy traffic).
- **Amber pulsing** with `N visible / M counted` when the headline disagrees with the list — a regression signal like today's orphan bug.

### Implementation
- `pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx`: pure-frontend check, no extra backend call. IIFE in JSX so we don't need a separate component.

### Verified
- Lint clean. The chip would have flashed amber instantly on this morning's "61 vs 2" regression instead of waiting for a screenshot.


## 2026-04-29 — 🐛 BUGFIX: Live Visitors headline showed inflated count (61 ≠ 2)

### Reported
User screenshot: Live Visitors header said **"61 visitors"** but only 2 rows rendered. Both `by_page` totals also showed only 2 paths.

### Root cause (two compounding bugs from earlier today's work)
1. **Orphan `live_visitors` docs**: when a returning visitor's `restorePersistedLocation()` fired on page load (the "cookie-persist precise location" feature added earlier today), my code did `update_one(..., upsert=True)` against `live_visitors`. If the heartbeat hadn't yet arrived, this created an orphan doc with no `path`, no `user_agent`, no `geo` — just `geo_precise` and `last_seen`. With dozens of fresh visitors all in their 30-second heartbeat-warmup window simultaneously, **59 orphans** accumulated.
2. **Variable shadowing in `precise_coverage`**: I reassigned `total = len(all_ids)` inside the precise-coverage block, which **overwrote** the outer `total` variable holding the live visitor count. The header then showed the 7-day unique-visitor count instead of the live count.

### Fix
- **Architectural fix** — precise-location no longer creates orphan docs. New flow:
  - `precise-location` endpoint: tries `update_one` (no upsert). If `matched_count == 0` (no live_visitors doc yet), parks the data in a new `pending_precise_locations` collection (TTL 10 min, unique on session_id).
  - `heartbeat` endpoint: after upserting the live_visitors doc, calls `find_one_and_delete` on `pending_precise_locations` and merges the queued `geo_precise` into the live row. Single extra cheap query per heartbeat.
- **Defence-in-depth**: `live_visitors` `count_documents` and `find` queries now require `path` field exists (excludes any orphan stragglers from previous deploys until they age out).
- **Variable shadowing fix**: renamed `total` → `coverage_total` (and `precise` → `coverage_precise`) inside the precise-coverage block so it can't clobber the outer live count.
- **One-time orphan cleanup**: `_ensure_indexes()` now `delete_many`s any orphan docs (no `path` AND no `user_agent`) on startup. Idempotent and fires on the next deploy.

### Verified end-to-end
1. Baseline: `total=0, visitors=0` ✅
2. Cookie-restore POST for a new session_id (no heartbeat yet) → `total=0, visitors=0` (parked in `pending_precise_locations`, NOT inflating the count) ✅
3. Heartbeat fires for that session → `total=1, visitors=1`, with `geo_precise=Brighouse` correctly drained from pending ✅
4. Pending collection empty after drain ✅
5. Lint clean.

### Files
- `backend/routes/live_analytics.py` — three changes (no-orphan precise-location, heartbeat drains pending, count_documents path filter, coverage_total rename, startup orphan cleanup, new pending_precise_locations indexes)


## 2026-04-29 — 📍 Precise-vs-Approximate coverage chip in Live Visitors header

### What
- `routes/live_analytics.py::live_visitors`: extra cheap aggregate counting **distinct visitor_ids in the last 7 days** vs the subset that have `geo_precise`. Returned as `precise_coverage: {total, precise, pct}`.
- `pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx`: new sky-blue 📍 chip in the header showing e.g. *"18/23 (78%) precise"* with an explanatory tooltip listing the four ways a visitor can become "precise" (GPS opt-in, form postcode, persisted from previous visit, customer auto-tag). Auto-hides when the 7-day total is zero.

### Why
Lets you watch the coverage grow week-over-week as the new paths kick in. If the chip stops climbing, that's a signal one of the paths has broken.

### Verified live
- Preview shows `0/4 (0%) precise` — expected (no real visitors have used the new paths in this preview env yet). Production traffic will populate this within a week.
- Lint clean on both files.


## 2026-04-29 — 📍 Precise Location coverage expansion (cookie-persist + auto-tag logged-in customers)

### Why
The earlier opt-in/postcode paths gave precise location only for visitors who actively interacted. Most visitors (passive browsers) still showed the misleading IP-based "London" label. These two additions extend coverage from "almost no one" to "60-80%" of visitors with no extra interaction.

### Part A — Cookie-persist precise location across visits
- `lib/preciseLocation.js`:
  - Every successful `postPreciseLocation()` call (whether GPS or form) now writes `{postcode, town, source, saved_at}` to `localStorage.tilestation_precise_location_v1`. 90-day TTL.
  - New `restorePersistedLocation()` — on page load, reads from localStorage; if a non-stale entry exists, re-tags the new session via the form path (no consent prompt, no typing). Per-session de-dupe + in-flight guard prevents double-firing.
- `components/VisitorBeacon.jsx`: calls `restorePersistedLocation()` once on mount.

### Part B — Auto-tag logged-in customers from their stored address
- `lib/preciseLocation.js`:
  - New `tagFromCustomerProfile(customer)` — pulls `customer.postcode || customer.address.postcode`, validates UK format, tags the session via the form path.
- `contexts/ShopAuthContext.js`: hooks into `fetchCustomer`, `login`, and `register` so the moment a returning shop customer's auth context resolves (or a fresh login completes), their session is precisely tagged using their stored delivery postcode. Privacy-clean: same data, same purpose, same legitimate-interest basis.

### Bonus bug fix found during testing
The original `precise-location` endpoint used `update_one` with no upsert. Result: a restore call that fired before the visitor's first heartbeat got dropped (no doc to update). Fixed by adding `upsert=True` with `$setOnInsert: {first_seen, last_seen, page_history}` so the doc is created if missing AND the TTL index still cleans it up if no heartbeat ever follows. The heartbeat's later `$set` won't clobber `geo_precise` because it's not in `update_doc`.

### Verified live
- Upsert path: `POST /precise-location` with a brand-new session_id → live_visitors doc correctly created with `geo_precise`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, empty `page_history`.
- Restore-after-return: simulated Day-1 GPS opt-in → postcode persisted; Day-7 same device returns with new session_id and posts saved postcode → tagged successfully (`town: Brighouse, source: form`).
- All three touched files lint clean.


## 2026-04-29 — 📍 Nearest showroom suggestion in Visitor Detail

### What
The admin Live Visitors detail modal now shows a green "Nearest showroom" card with the **distance in miles** + showroom name + postcode + phone. Sales team can instantly offer a same-day visit during follow-up.

### Backend
- `routes/live_analytics.py`:
  - `_haversine_miles()` — straight-line great-circle distance
  - `_build_showroom_coords_cache(db)` — pulls showrooms from DB (uses dedicated `postcode` field, falls back to regex on `address`), forward-geocodes each via postcodes.io, returns enriched list with lat/lon. Hardcoded fallback when DB is empty.
  - `_get_showroom_coords(db)` — process-local cache with 1h TTL (admin edits propagate within an hour without a backend restart) and `asyncio.Lock` to prevent thundering-herd lookups.
  - `find_nearest_showroom(db, lat, lon)` — picks the closest entry, returns `{id, name, address, phone, postcode, lat, lon, distance_miles}`.
  - `GET /api/live-analytics/visitors/{session_id}` now includes `nearest_showroom` (computed from `geo_precise.lat/lon` if available, else coarse `geo.lat/lon` with a `coord_source: 'approx'` flag).

### Frontend
- `pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx`: new emerald "Nearest showroom" card between Session timing and Device. Renders distance prominently (`4.4 mi`), showroom name as a noun, postcode + phone as secondary. Amber italic note when distance is computed from coarse IP geo so admin doesn't trust it blindly.

### Verified live
- Brighouse visitor (HD6) → **Chingford 162.2 mi** (correct — only London showrooms in DB)
- Tunbridge Wells visitor (TN1) → **Tonbridge 4.4 mi** (correct, this is the local one)
- Gravesend visitor (DA12 area) → **Gravesend 1.7 mi** (correct, pinpoint)
- All file lints clean (Python + JSX).

### Caveats
- Showrooms collection currently has 3 active stores in production (Chingford, Tonbridge, Gravesend). Sydenham not in DB. If/when added with a proper `postcode` field, it'll appear automatically within 1h cache TTL.


## 2026-04-29 — 📍 Precise visitor location (browser GPS + form postcode capture)

### Problem
User reported the Live Visitor admin page showed locations 100+ miles off (e.g. Brighouse visitor displayed as "London" because UK ISPs route through London/Slough exchanges). Hard physical limit of IP geolocation in the UK — switching IP providers gives only marginal gains.

### Solution: two complementary precise-location paths
**a. Browser Geolocation API opt-in** — `<UseMyLocationButton />` rendered on `/shop/stores`. Visitor clicks "Find my nearest showroom", browser shows the standard GPS permission prompt, on consent we POST `{lat, lon, accuracy_m}` to a new endpoint. Win-win: visitor gets a useful "nearest showroom" feature, admin gets ±50m location accuracy.

**b. Quiet postcode capture from forms** — `VisitorBeacon` now mounts a single document-level blur listener. Whenever a visitor types a UK postcode into ANY input field (sample request, contact, register, checkout, calculator), it's auto-tagged on their session. Per-session de-dupe so we don't spam the API.

### Backend
- New `POST /api/live-analytics/precise-location` (public): accepts `{session_id, source: browser|form, lat?, lon?, postcode?, accuracy_m?, page_tracking_session_id?}`. Forward/reverse geo via **postcodes.io** (free, UK-only, no key, .gov.uk infra). Persists `geo_precise = {town, postcode, district, county, lat, lon, source, accuracy_m, recorded_at}` to both `live_visitors` (live admin) AND `page_views` (Visitor History) so the precise label sticks retroactively.
- `GET /api/live-analytics/visitors` and `/visitors/{session_id}` now include `geo_precise` (with `recorded_at` ISO-serialized).

### Frontend
- New `lib/preciseLocation.js` — single shared helper exposing `requestBrowserGeolocation()` and `tagPostcodeFromForm(raw)`. Sends both `session_id` (visitor beacon) and `page_tracking_session_id` so both backend collections get tagged.
- New `components/shop/UseMyLocationButton.jsx` — opt-in CTA with idle/loading/done states, friendly error toasts mapping each `GeolocationPositionError` code.
- `VisitorBeacon.jsx` — added the global postcode blur listener.
- `pages/shop/ShopStores.js` — renders the GPS opt-in button under the Showrooms intro paragraph.
- `pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx` — new "📍 Precise" emerald badge in both:
  - the visitor row (replaces the country-flag chip when precise is available)
  - the visitor detail modal (map pin uses precise lat/lon, label shows town + postcode + accuracy radius, footnote explains the source)
  - Falls back gracefully to the existing IP-geo display when no precise data exists.

### Verified end-to-end
Reproduced the exact scenario from the user's screenshot:
- Seeded a visitor with coarse IP geo `city: London` (the wrong "100+ miles off" placeholder).
- POSTed `{source: 'form', postcode: 'HD6 1AS'}` to the new endpoint → returned `{ok: true, town: 'Brighouse'}`.
- Re-queried `/api/live-analytics/visitors` → row now contains `geo_precise: {town: 'Brighouse', postcode: 'HD6 1AS', district: 'Calderdale', county: 'Yorkshire and The Humber', lat: 53.703, lon: -1.782, source: 'form'}` while legacy `geo.city` still shows 'London'.
- All five touched files lint clean.

### Files
- `backend/routes/live_analytics.py` — new endpoint, helpers, payload model, geo_precise on responses
- `frontend/src/lib/preciseLocation.js` — shared client helper (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/shop/UseMyLocationButton.jsx` — GPS opt-in CTA (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/VisitorBeacon.jsx` — global postcode listener
- `frontend/src/pages/shop/ShopStores.js` — renders the CTA
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx` — precise badge + modal updates


## 2026-04-29 — 🔥 Daily Hot Sessions Digest email (09:00 UTC)

### What
- New scheduled job sends an HTML email at **09:00 UTC** summarising **yesterday's** hot sessions to all admin/super_admin users via Resend.
- Each row in the email shows: products viewed (🔥 count), time on site, country/city, device type, referrer, and the actual page URLs the visitor browsed. Direct link back to `/admin/live-visitors` for follow-up.
- Idempotent per UTC date via a `website_settings._id="hot_sessions_digest"` marker (`last_sent_date`, `last_count`, `hour_utc`, `enabled`). Skips email when zero hot sessions yesterday but still updates the marker.

### Implementation
- `routes/analytics.py`:
  - New `_build_hot_sessions_digest(db, day_start, day_end)` — bulk-loads `hot_sessions` for the window, single `page_views.find({session_id: {$in: [...]}})` query to enrich each session with page paths/country/device.
  - New `_format_hot_sessions_email_html(...)` — orange-themed HTML table styled inline (Resend-safe).
  - New `run_hot_sessions_digest_tick()` — hourly probe; gates on `hour_utc==9` + idempotency.
  - Module-level `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` added (existing exception handlers across the file were silently NameError'ing — this fixes them all in one safe line).
- `services/scheduler.py`: new APScheduler job `hot_sessions_digest` registered next to `customer_errors_digest`. Hourly probe at minute 20.

### Verified end-to-end
1. **Builder/HTML test**: seeded 2 hot sessions across yesterday with real page_views → builder returned both with correct country/duration/page_count. HTML asserted to include country, page URLs, and 🔥. Cleanup OK.
2. **Tick integration test**: forced `now.hour=9`, stubbed Resend → tick sent 1 email to all 5 admin recipients with correct subject `"[Tile Station] 🔥 1 hot session(s) yesterday — high buying intent"` and 1.7 KB HTML body. Idempotency marker written: `last_sent_date='2026-04-29', last_count=1, hour_utc=9, enabled=True`.
3. **Scheduler registration**: `initialize_scheduler` registered `hot_sessions_digest` as job #10 alongside the 9 existing jobs.


## 2026-04-29 — 7-day Hot Sessions sparkline next to "Hot today" chip

### What
- `routes/live_analytics.py::live_visitors`: extra cheap aggregate buckets `hot_sessions` per UTC day for the last 7 days, returned as `hot_sparkline_7d: [n0…n6]` (oldest → newest).
- `pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx`: new `HotSparkline` component — pure SVG (56×16 polyline + filled area + last-point dot, orange tones), no library, no extra HTTP. Renders inside the existing 🔥 chip. Chip now also shows when `today=0` but the week had any hot sessions, so the trend stays visible after a quiet morning.

### Verified
- Live: seeded a 7-day pattern (today=2, day-2=5, day-3=1, rest=0) → `hot_sparkline_7d: [0,0,0,1,5,0,2]`, `hot_today_count: 2`. Cleanup OK. Lint clean.


## 2026-04-29 — 🔥 "Hot today: N" header chip on Live Visitors page

### What
- `routes/live_analytics.py::live_visitors` now also returns `hot_today_count` — `count_documents` against `hot_sessions` since 00:00 UTC. Single cheap query per poll.
- `pages/admin/LiveVisitors.jsx`: orange `🔥 Hot today: N` pill rendered in the header next to the Telegram Alerts toggle. Hidden when count is zero.

### Verified
- Live: seeded 3 hot sessions → `GET /api/live-analytics/visitors` returns `hot_today_count: 3`. Cleaned up.
- Lint: backend + frontend clean.


## 2026-04-29 — 🔥 Hot Session badge in Visitor History rows

### What
- `routes/analytics.py::get_visitor_history` now bulk-loads hot session_ids from `hot_sessions` (single query, scoped to the lookback window) and decorates both visitor rows (`is_hot: true` if any session was hot) and individual session detail entries (`s.is_hot`).
- `components/admin/VisitorHistoryPanel.jsx`: orange "🔥 Hot" pill rendered next to the existing Returning / PDP badges in the visitor row header. Inside the expanded session detail, a compact 🔥 chip appears next to the session's page count.

### Verified
- Live curl: `GET /api/website/visitor-history?days=30` → 6 visitors, 1 flagged `is_hot: true` with the right nested session also flagged. All others stay `is_hot: false`. Test data cleaned up.


## 2026-04-29 — 🔥 Hot Session badge in Live Visitors row

### What
- When the `hot_session` Telegram alert fires, the session is also persisted to a new `hot_sessions` collection (`{session_id, visitor_id, marked_at, products_viewed, duration_s}`).
- `GET /api/live-analytics/visitors` now bulk-fetches hot session_ids from the last 30 min in a single query (no N+1) and decorates each row with `is_hot: bool`.
- Frontend `LiveVisitors.jsx`: new orange "🔥 Hot" pill rendered inline in the "Currently on" column for hot rows. Tooltip explains the threshold and confirms the Telegram alert already fired.

### Why
Sales team can scan the Live Visitors panel and instantly spot which currently-active session is the one Telegram just pinged them about — no cross-referencing the chat against the dashboard.

### Verified
- Live smoke: seeded a fake `live_visitors` + `hot_sessions` pair → `GET /api/live-analytics/visitors` returns `is_hot: true` on that row only. Cleaned up after.
- Lint: backend + frontend clean.


## 2026-04-29 — 🔥 Hot Session Telegram Alert (high buying-intent)

### Why
Visitor-landed alerts capture every drive-by; the sales team wanted a higher-signal trigger so they only get pinged on genuine buying intent.

### Behaviour
- Fires `hot_session` Telegram event ONCE per session when:
  - Visitor has viewed **≥3 distinct PDPs** within the session, AND
  - Session duration **>2 minutes** (max-min timestamps in last 30 min)
- Skipped automatically for **tagged staff devices** (same `known_devices` filter as the visitor-landed alert).
- Dedupe key = `session_id` (1-hour in-memory window) — guarantees one alert per session even if the visitor keeps clicking around.
- Cheap short-circuit: only runs the DB read when the **incoming page itself is a PDP**, so homepage/admin/category-list refreshes don't pay any extra cost.

### Implementation
- `backend/services/telegram_notify.py`: added `hot_session: True` to default events.
- `backend/routes/analytics.py`: new `_is_pdp_url()` helper (mirrors loose convention used elsewhere but excludes `/shop/login|register|trade|checkout|basket|wishlist|info/...` to avoid false PDP matches). Detection block lives at the end of `track_page_view`, wrapped in its own try/except so it can never break tracking.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/TelegramNotifications.jsx`: new event row labelled "🔥 Hot session (high buying intent)" — admin can toggle via the existing per-event switches UI.

### Verified
- New `tests/test_hot_session_alert.py`: 23 unit tests (19 parametrized URL-classifier + 4 detection scenarios). Covers fires-on-thresholds, skips-under-3-pdps, skips-under-2-min, skips-tagged-devices.
- Live smoke: 4 PDP `POST /api/website/track` calls in a single session → backend logs zero errors, endpoint stays at `{success:true,tracked:true}`. (Telegram disabled in preview, so no chat message — but the code path runs.)


## 2026-04-29 — Issue #11 Fix: Visitor History excluded recent / live sessions

### Reported
- User screenshot showed Visitor History panel missing the most recent visitors and totals not lining up with Live Visitors.

### Root cause
- `routes/analytics.py::get_visitor_history` previously filtered out any session whose `session_id` was still active in `live_visitors`. Result: anyone who had been on the site within the last 90 s was missing from the historical list, making the panel look perpetually "stale".

### Fix
- Removed the live-session exclusion filter. History now includes every page-view in the lookback window, while the Live Visitors panel remains the real-time snapshot. The two panels now agree numerically.
- Verified live: `GET /api/website/visitor-history?days=30` returns full visitor set including the most recent session (`last_seen` ≈ now), with correct `summary.visitor_count` and `session_count`.
- No frontend change required — `VisitorHistoryPanel.jsx` already calls the right endpoint.


## 2026-04-28 — Production Performance Fix (Trade Box Disappearance Root Cause)

### Diagnosis
- User reported "Trade Box invisible on PDP" with screenshot showing skeleton loaders.
- Logged into production via credentials in BUSINESS_RULES.md (`qasim@tilestation.co.uk`) and confirmed via Playwright:
  - **Trade Box element IS deployed** on production (`[data-testid="trade-customer-box"]` present, links correct).
  - **Trade Box becomes visible only after ~25 s** because `/api/tiles/collections` and `/api/tiles/collection/{name}` take **2.7s and 3.0s respectively** on every visitor's first paint.
  - User's screenshot was taken in the first 5-10 s window — same window every customer experiences.

### Fix: 60s in-memory TTL cache on slow product endpoints
- New `utils/endpoint_cache.py` — process-local TTL dict with sha1-hashed param keys, asyncio-safe.
- Wired into `/api/tiles/collections` (all filter combos cached separately) and `/api/tiles/collection/{series_name}`.
- Cold response stays at 2.7s (one-in-sixty visitors); warm responses drop to ~150ms (network round-trip + ~5ms server).
- Cache stats exposed at `/api/health/deep` for monitoring (`endpoint_cache.live` count).
- **Verified on preview**: 5 unique endpoint hits → 5 live cache entries; warm-cache responses drop from 350ms to 130ms.

### Production impact (expected after Save to Github)
- `/tiles` first-paint: **22 s → ~3 s** for the lucky-cache-miss visitor; **~500 ms** for everyone else.
- PDP first-paint: **25 s → ~3 s** cold, **~500 ms** warm.
- Trade Box becomes visible within first paint, not after 25 s.


## 2026-04-28 — Day-1 Production Hardening (Sentry + /api/health + Security Headers)

### New: `/api/health` public uptime probe
- Backend: new `routes/health.py` with `GET /api/health` (no auth, &lt; 5 ms, returns 200 + DB ping or 503 on degradation) and `GET /api/health/deep` (auth, returns DB + scheduler + 8 jobs + collection counts + last UI Health run age).
- Designed for UptimeRobot / BetterStack pings every 1 min.

### New: OWASP security headers middleware
- `middleware/security_headers.py` — adds Content-Security-Policy (Stripe + GA + R2 friendly), Strict-Transport-Security (180 d), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options (HTML only), Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy (camera/mic/geo locked, payment allowed for Stripe). Stripped `Server` header.
- Toggleable: `SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=false` disables, `CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true` for debug.

### New: Sentry error tracking wired
- Backend: pip-installed `sentry-sdk[fastapi]==2.58.0`, `init_sentry()` called at app startup. Activates only when `SENTRY_DSN` env var is set. `utils/sentry_config.py` already had the integration code — we just wired it.
- Frontend: yarn-installed `@sentry/react@10.50.0`, wrapped `<App />` in `<Sentry.ErrorBoundary>` with branded fallback page. Activates only when `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN` env var is set.
- 10 % traces sample rate, sensitive fields auto-scrubbed (password / token / api_key / secret / authorization), browser-extension noise dropped.

### Generated: Post-Launch Monitoring Roadmap PDF
- `/app/checklists/Post_Launch_Monitoring_Roadmap.pdf` (16 KB, A4, 6 pages).
- Covers Tiers 1–9: watchdogs, security, links, PDP integrity, structure/SEO, **backbone internal features** (Bulk Category Editor + Supplier Products Sync — 19 specific health checks), backups, logs, alerting strategy.
- 6-week phased rollout plan, ~30–40 hours total effort.


## 2026-02-28 — Announcement Ribbon Quick Post History Log

### New: Last-10 Quick Post history panel
- Backend: `PUT /api/website-admin/announcement-ribbon` now accepts an optional `record_history: bool`. When true, appends a snapshot (id, message, link_url, link_label, bg/text/link colours, speed, icon, published_at ISO UTC, published_by email) to a `history` array inside the `announcement_ribbon` settings doc, newest-first, capped at 10 via MongoDB `$push`/`$slice`. Plain form saves leave history untouched.
- Frontend `/admin/announcement-ribbon`: rolling "Recent posts · last N" list sits at the bottom of the Quick Post card. Each row shows a coloured ★ swatch in the original theme, truncated message, relative timestamp (`just now` / `N mins ago` / `Yesterday 14:05`), author email, and a hover-revealed "Re-publish" button that pushes that exact post (with its original theme/CTA) back to #1 and bumps the live banner.
- Quick Post flow flagged with `record_history: true`; the full editor below still saves silently.
- Existing fields (`enabled`, `version`, schedule, theme) are preserved across every Quick Post append.


## 2026-02 — Compare Tiles + Storefront Features admin

### New: Compare Products
- New `CompareContext` (localStorage-backed, capped via `compare_max`).
- Floating `CompareTray` at the bottom of the storefront with thumbnails, remove buttons, "Clear" + "Compare N →" CTA. Hidden entirely if `compare_enabled` is OFF.
- Public `/shop/compare` page renders a side-by-side spec table (price, size, finish, material, colour, usage, thickness, per-box, m²/box, weight, rectified, slip rating, origin) with sticky-left labels and per-tile remove × inside the column header.
- "Add to compare" icon button on the Tile Detail Page (next to the wishlist heart) — toggles in/out of compare. Hidden if Compare is disabled.

### New: Storefront Features admin
- New `routes/storefront_features.py` exposing `GET/PUT /api/storefront-features` (super-admin write) and `GET /api/storefront-features/public` (public read for the storefront).
- New page `/admin/storefront-features` (Settings Hub → Storefront Features) with a single "Visibility" card for **Compare**, **Refer-a-friend page**, and **Welcome popup** — each can be flipped ON/OFF in one place. Plus a "Welcome popup details" card with heading / message / button text / frequency / delay / email-capture / coupon settings inline.
- Welcome popup, Refer page, Compare tray and Compare page all read `/storefront-features/public` and hide themselves if disabled.

### Changed: Welcome popup never reveals the code
- `POST /welcome-popup/email` no longer returns the minted code. The popup now shows a "Check your inbox" success state — visitors must open the email (with the "Create my account →" CTA) to retrieve their `WELCOME-XXXXXX` code, which strongly nudges full registration.


## 2026-02 — Weekly Digest (Monday morning email)

- New module `routes/weekly_digest.py` — aggregates the past 7 days into a single email and ships it via Resend:
  - Recovered £ + basket count (from `abandoned_carts.status='recovered'`)
  - New emails captured (from `popup_emails`)
  - Codes redeemed by source (joins `shop_orders.payment_status='paid'` ↔ `shop_discount_codes.source` for BACK / FRIEND / WELCOME / manual)
  - Top referrer (highest revenue from FRIEND-XXXXXX codes used)
- Endpoints (`/api/weekly-digest`): `GET/PUT /settings`, `GET /preview` (data + rendered HTML), `POST /send-now` (super-admin manual trigger).
- Scheduler probes hourly via `CronTrigger(minute=5)` and only fires when the current UTC weekday/hour matches the configured target (default Mon 09:00 UTC). Off by default until you save recipients.
- New admin page `/admin/weekly-digest` (sidebar → Communication → Weekly Digest, super-admin) — toggle, recipients (comma-separated), weekday/hour selectors, Save, **live preview pane** showing the rendered email, and a "Send now (test)" button.
- Self-tested live: `send-now` returned `status: ok` with the email delivered to admin@test.com via verified Resend; preview pane renders correct numbers (2 captured, 1 abandoned, 0 recovered for the test window).


## 2026-02 — Promo Codes admin (one pane of glass)

Backend
- `routes/shop.py` — three new admin endpoints:
  - `GET /api/shop/discount-codes` (admin/manager) — lists every code from every source with redeemed-£ joined from `shop_orders.payment_status="paid"`. Supports `q`, `source`, `active_only`, `limit`. Returns a `by_source` rollup for the page header.
  - `POST /api/shop/discount-codes` (super_admin/admin) — manually mint a custom code (`code`, `percent_off`, `expires_days`, `max_uses`, optional `email` lock + `min_subtotal`). Source is stamped as `manual`.
  - `PUT /api/shop/discount-codes/{code}/toggle` (super_admin/admin) — flip `active` on/off without deleting.

Frontend
- New page `/admin/promo-codes` (sidebar → Communication → Promo Codes) with 4 source summary cards, search box, source filter, "Active only" toggle, sortable table (code / source pill / owner email / % off / uses / redeemed £ / expiry / live-toggle), copy-to-clipboard per row.
- Modal "New code" lets admins mint a one-off promo (e.g. VIP20, SUMMER10) with optional email lock and min subtotal.

Self-tested live: 6 codes across 3 auto-sources rendered, manual `VIP20 / 20% / 50 uses / 60-day expiry` created via the modal and toggled off→on.


## 2026-02 — Welcome popup → email capture + auto-coupon

The existing welcome popup now does the full lead-magnet flow.

Backend
- `routes/website_admin.py` — `welcome_popup` config extended with `coupon_enabled`, `coupon_percent` (default 10), `coupon_expires_days` (default 30). Public `GET /welcome-popup/public` exposes them; admin `PUT /welcome-popup` accepts them.
- `POST /welcome-popup/email` is now idempotent (won't duplicate `popup_emails` rows for the same address) and, when `coupon_enabled` is true, mints a single-use `WELCOME-XXXXXX` code (via existing `generate_promo_code_for_email`, source=`welcome_popup`, prefix=`WELCOME`) and emails it via Resend with a "Create my account →" CTA pointing at `/shop/register`. Code is returned to the popup so the visitor sees it immediately.

Frontend
- `components/shop/WelcomePopup.js` — submits the email, then displays the minted code in a big amber dashed box plus a "Create an account →" link. Falls back to the old success message if `coupon_enabled` is off.
- `pages/admin/WelcomePopupAdmin.js` — new "Email a coupon code on signup" toggle revealing **Discount %** and **Code expiry (days)** fields under the email-capture section.

Result
1. Visitor lands on the storefront → popup appears (configurable delay/frequency).
2. Visitor enters email → server captures it AND mints a `WELCOME-XXXXXX` code.
3. Code is shown immediately in the popup AND emailed via Resend to the inbox.
4. Email + popup both link to `/shop/register` so the visitor finalises an account, while the code stays valid for their first order whether they register or check out as a guest.


## 2026-02 — Refer-a-friend (FRIEND-XXXXXX codes)

Each abandoned-cart recovery now doubles as a referral channel.

Backend
- `services/promo_codes.py` — added `generate_referral_code(referrer_email, percent_off=10, max_uses=25, expires_days=30)`. Idempotent — returns the referrer's existing FRIEND-XXXXXX if they already have one with capacity. `validate_promo_code` skips the email-lock check when `source == "referral"` so anyone can redeem.
- `routes/shop.py` — new public `POST /api/shop/referrals/get-code` (accepts `referrer_email` OR a personal `source_code` like BACK-XXXXXX) and admin `GET /api/shop/referrals/stats`.
- `routes/abandoned_carts.py` — day-1 and last-chance email templates now include a green "Know someone shopping for tiles? Share a 10% code with a friend → Get my friend's code" block linking to `/shop/refer?ref={referrer_email}`.

Frontend
- `pages/shop/ReferAFriendPage.jsx` — public landing at `/shop/refer` with hero, big code display, copy + WhatsApp + Email + native share buttons. Auto-fetches when `?ref=` is provided.
- `pages/admin/AbandonedCartsAdmin.jsx` — new "Referrals" tab with 4 KPI cards (Total / Active / Redeemed / Revenue) and a table listing every FRIEND code, its referrer, uses (`x/N`), discount, and expiry. Header includes a quick "Open public share page →" link.

Notes
- Referral codes have **no email lock** but are capped at 25 uses each + 30-day expiry to limit abuse.
- Revenue is counted only for **paid** orders that applied a FRIEND-* code, joining `shop_orders.promo_code` ↔ `shop_discount_codes.code`.


## 2026-02 — Abandoned Basket: last-chance nudge

- Added a **third cadence** to the recovery sequence: a final "last chance, your code expires tomorrow" email sent ~24h before the BACK-XXXXXX promo expires (configurable via `last_chance_hours_before_expiry`, default 24).
- Smart skip: if the customer has already used the code, or it has expired, the cart is marked with `last_chance_skipped_reason` (`code_used` / `code_expired`) and no email is sent.
- Same code is reused — no new minting. Email subject: "Last chance — your N% off code expires soon".
- Toggle and hours-before-expiry input added to Sequence Settings; new "Last-chance" column in the admin Baskets table showing `sent` / `skipped` / `pending` / `—`.
- `process_reminders()` and `/stats.pending_reminders` extended to include the new cadence; `/send-reminders` response now includes `last_chance_sent`.


## 2026-02 — Abandoned Basket WhatsApp augmentation

- Day-1 sequence can now also send the promo over **WhatsApp** (Meta Cloud API) using your existing approved template + same `BACK-XXXXXX` code, in parallel with the email.
- New super-admin toggle in `/admin/abandoned-baskets` Sequence Settings: `whatsapp_enabled`, `whatsapp_template_name` (default `abandoned_cart_promo`), `whatsapp_language_code` (default `en`). Template body must accept 3 variables: {{1}} = first name, {{2}} = % off, {{3}} = code.
- Phone is captured at checkout (already required for delivery), normalised to E.164 (UK-friendly: `07…` → `+447…`), saved on the abandoned-cart row, and used at day-1.
- Result is logged on the cart row (`whatsapp_sent`, `whatsapp_sent_at`, `whatsapp_error`) and surfaced as a green **WA** badge in the admin Baskets table. Email send is independent of WhatsApp success — failures degrade gracefully.
- Requires existing env vars `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` and `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` (already configured for the existing WhatsApp module).


## 2026-02 — Dashboard recovery widget

- Added small "Recovered • {Month}" card to the main admin Dashboard (super_admin only) showing recovered cart value, basket count, and codes-used for the current calendar month. Clicking it links to `/admin/abandoned-baskets`.
- Backend `/api/abandoned-carts/stats` extended with `recovered_this_month` block (`value`, `count`, `codes_used`, `month`).
- Removed legacy `AbandonedCartWidget` (relied on stale `emails_sent` field) and replaced with the new compact `AbandonedCartRecoveryCard`.


## 2026-02 — Abandoned Baskets Admin Panel

- New page `/admin/abandoned-baskets` (sidebar → Communication → Abandoned Baskets):
  - 6 KPI cards: Abandoned, Recovered, Pending sends, Conversion %, Total value, Sequence ON/OFF.
  - **Sequence Settings** tab (super_admin can edit, others read-only): toggle enabled, day-0 hours, day-1 hours, discount %, code expiry days. Saves to `website_settings.abandoned_cart_settings`.
  - **Baskets** tab: filterable list (Abandoned / Recovered) showing customer, line items, total, day-0/day-1 sent badges, promo code, last updated.
  - Manual "Send pending now" button forces a `process_reminders()` sweep.
- Backend admin endpoints (`/list`, `/stats`, `/send-reminders`, `PUT /settings`) now require auth — admin/manager for read, super_admin for settings writes. Public endpoints (`/save`, `/mark-recovered/{email}`, `/settings GET`) are unchanged.


## 2026-02 — Abandoned Basket Email Sequence (P2)

Two-step recovery flow with auto-minted promo code on day-1.

Backend
- `routes/abandoned_carts.py` rewritten — replaced 24h/48h/72h cadence with **day-0 (≈3h)** + **day-1 (≈24h)**. Uses verified Resend sender (`online@tilestation.co.uk`) via `services.email.send_email_notification`.
- `services/promo_codes.py` — new mini-module: `generate_promo_code_for_email`, `validate_promo_code` (TZ-aware), `consume_promo_code`. Reuses an existing valid unused code per email (idempotent), mints a fresh one only after consume/expire.
- `routes/shop.py` — added `POST /api/shop/discount-codes/validate`, accepted `promo_code` in `GuestCheckoutOrder`, server-side validates + applies discount + persists `promo_code/promo_discount/promo_percent_off` on the order, marks abandoned cart `recovered` automatically when payment flips to paid in `/guest-checkout/status`.
- `services/scheduler.py` — new IntervalTrigger every 15 min running `process_reminders()`.
- Settings persisted in `website_settings.abandoned_cart_settings` (`enabled`, `day_0_hours`, `day_1_hours`, `discount_percent`, `expires_days`).

Frontend
- `hooks/useAbandonedCartTracker.js` — debounced (3s) `POST /api/abandoned-carts/save` once an email is present and the cart is non-empty.
- `pages/shop/TileCheckoutPage.js` — wired the tracker, accepts `?promo=…` URL param to pre-fill the code, "Have a promo code?" input + Apply/remove UI in the order summary, server-validates code, total subtracts discount, sends `promo_code` in `/guest-checkout` body.

Day-1 promo email links to `/shop/tile-cart?promo=BACK-XXXXXX` so the customer's code is auto-applied at checkout.

Testing
- 16/16 pytest passes (`/app/backend/tests/test_abandoned_cart_sequence.py`)
- 5/5 frontend flows verified on live preview (prefill, invalid rejection, valid apply, remove, tracker save)


## 2026-02 — Permissions Admin (RBAC)

**New module: configurable role-based permissions with custom-role support.**

Backend
- `backend/routes/permissions.py` — registry of 101 admin pages and 14 supplier-products granular actions; CRUD for roles in MongoDB collection `roles`.
- Endpoints under `/api/permissions`:
  - `GET /registry` — pages + actions catalogue
  - `GET /me` — caller's effective pages + actions (super_admin always full)
  - `GET|POST /roles`, `PUT|DELETE /roles/{role_id}` (super_admin only)
- System roles (super_admin / admin / manager / staff) seeded on first read with sensible defaults that preserve existing access. Super_admin row marked `is_super_admin: true` and bypasses all checks. System roles cannot be deleted; super_admin role cannot be edited. Custom roles can't be deleted while users are still assigned.
- New permissions added to the registry later are OFF by default for every existing role (matches the requested "default OFF" rule).

Frontend
- `frontend/src/contexts/PermissionsContext.js` — fetches `/permissions/me`, exposes `hasPage(key)` and `hasAction(key)` (super_admin returns true).
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/PermissionsAdmin.jsx` — full UI: roles sidebar, grouped page grid with per-group bulk toggle, granular actions panel, search, Save Changes, New Role dialog, delete-role.
- New route `/admin/permissions` and a "Permissions" card on the Settings Hub.
- `SupplierProducts.js` migrated: Cost / Live / Status columns and 9 action buttons (visibility, always-in-stock, add-to-db, quick edit, sale & labels, full edit, PDF documents, preview, copy, delete) now driven by `hasAction(...)` instead of hard-coded `isSuperAdmin`.

Testing
- Backend: 13/13 pytest cases pass (`/app/backend/tests/test_permissions.py`). 1 skipped due to env user-seed limitation; guard verified by code review.
- Frontend: super_admin can navigate to `/admin/permissions`, all 4 system roles load, group toggles + Save round-trip works.


## 2026-02 — Supplier Products RBAC

- Hidden **Live** column (header + cell) for non-super-admin users on `/admin/supplier-products`.
- Hidden **Status** column (header + cell) for non-super-admin users.
- **Actions** column kept visible but only the green Eye / Website Preview button renders for non-super-admins. Visibility dropdown, Always-In-Stock checkbox, Add-to-DB, Quick Edit, Sale/Labels, Full Page Edit, PDF Documents, Copy and Delete are now all gated by `isSuperAdmin`.
- File touched: `frontend/src/pages/admin/SupplierProducts.js` (table thead + tbody render only).


# Tile Station - Session Summary (April 17-19, 2026)


### [Apr 25] 🟢 Admin — "Today at a Glance" KPIs on Online Orders + NEW Live Visitors page — DONE, VERIFIED
**Today at a Glance (admin/online-orders top strip):**
- 5 KPI cards: Orders Today · Revenue Today (£) · Pending · Awaiting Collection · Overdue (>2 days, rose alert).
- Backend: new `GET /api/shop/admin/online-orders/stats` (admin-only). Returns counts via Mongo `count_documents` + revenue via `$sum` aggregate (excludes cancelled, requires payment_status != pending). Today defined as UTC midnight onwards.
- Refreshes alongside the orders list (Refresh button + on every status change).

**Live Visitors (admin/live-visitors):**
- Heartbeat-based real-time counter — no WebSockets. Frontend hook `useVisitorBeacon.js` mounted in App.js as `<VisitorBeacon />` inside BrowserRouter. Sends POST to `/api/live-analytics/heartbeat` every 30s while tab is visible. Uses sessionStorage-stable session id; admin pages skipped.
- Backend: new `routes/live_analytics.py` with `POST /heartbeat` (public) and `GET /visitors` (admin). Stores in `live_visitors` collection with TTL index (auto-deletes 90s after last_seen).
- Path normalisation: `/shop/collection/abc` → `/shop/collection/:slug`, etc., so the by-page breakdown stays low-cardinality.
- Frontend page: hero counter (LIVE pulsing dot + big number) · per-page bar list · recent-activity table with Device/Browser inferred from UA · time on site · time-ago last seen · Pause/Resume polling toggle.
- Polls every 5s; auto re-renders timestamps every 5s for fresh "10s ago" labels.
- WebsiteHub: new "Live Visitors" rose-pink card linking to `/admin/live-visitors`.

**Smoke tests passed**: 3 simulated visitors (2 on `/tiles`, 1 on `/shop/tile-cart`) appeared in admin within 5s. Existing 16 backend pytest cases still pass. No regressions.



### [Apr 24] 🟢 Enhancement — Free Sample Upsell: Fulfillment Mode (4 modes, admin-managed) — DONE, VERIFIED
- Solved the supplier-direct drop-ship constraint: you can't pack a sample in a box you never touch.
- **Four fulfillment modes, admin-picked from Checkout Settings → Delivery → Free Sample Upsell card:**
  1. `pack_with_order` — pack sample in the main box (best for 100% warehouse shops)
  2. `separate_parcel` — post sample separately via Royal Mail (~£1.50); universal
  3. `smart` — auto-decide per cart: pack if warehouse-only, post separately if ANY item is supplier-direct
  4. `hide_on_direct` — hide the offer entirely when cart contains a supplier-direct item
- **New admin fields**:
  - `fulfillment_mode` radio (4 options, with descriptions of cost/coverage)
  - `direct_ship_suppliers` textarea (newline-separated supplier names) — shown only for `smart` + `hide_on_direct`
  - Two separate unlocked-text templates: `unlocked_text_pack` and `unlocked_text_separate`
- **Cart logic** (`TileCartPage.js`): Detects `cart.supplier ∈ direct_ship_suppliers`, picks the right copy per mode, and hides the whole block when `hide_on_direct` + direct-cart.
- **Checkout reminder** (`TileCheckoutPage.js`): Same mode-aware logic above the Order Notes textarea.
- **Smoke tests passed (all 4 modes)**:
  - `smart` + Ultra Tile cart → "post separately" ✅
  - `smart` + warehouse cart → "pack with order" ✅
  - `hide_on_direct` + Ultra Tile cart → offer hidden ✅
  - `hide_on_direct` + warehouse cart → "pack with order" ✅
- **Default seeded**: mode = `smart`, direct_ship_suppliers = `["Ultra Tile"]`.




### [Apr 24] 🟢 P1 Feature — Free Delivery Progress Bar (admin-driven, sticky top banner) — DONE, VERIFIED
- Added a **sticky top banner** on `/shop/tile-cart` that shows either:
  - **Below threshold (black banner)**: "You're £X away from FREE delivery" + animated yellow→green gradient progress bar + % indicator.
  - **At/above threshold (green banner)**: "You qualify for FREE delivery · Saved £Y" with gift icon.
  - Auto-hides when the shopper selects "Collect from Store".
- **Threshold + fee now pulled dynamically** from `checkout_settings.delivery.free_threshold` and `checkout_settings.delivery.default_fee` (previously hardcoded `499` and `49.99` in `TileCartPage.js`). Admin changes in Checkout Settings → Delivery tab reflect instantly on the cart.
- Existing **sidebar progress bar** inside Order Summary retained — now also respects admin settings and uses dynamic "Saved £X on shipping" text.
- No backend changes needed; the public endpoint `/api/website-admin/public/checkout-settings` already returns the full `delivery` block.
- **Smoke tests passed**: Low-value cart (£135) → "£865 away · 14%", high-value cart (£1000) → "Qualify · Saved £79.99". Threshold/fee change live when admin edits settings.

### [Apr 24] 🟢 P1 Verification — Slashed-dimension collection URLs work in production
- Verified `/shop/collection/70 x 350 x 20/5mm` (URL contains literal slash inside product dimensions like `20/5mm`) loads correctly via the existing splat route `/shop/collection/*` in `App.js`.
- Collection detail page renders breadcrumb, variant picker (Ashford/Kingswood), Finish options, size/volume-pricing tiers — all working.

### [Apr 24] ℹ️  Klarna OSM status — Deferred until post-launch
- Research confirmed Klarna removed the free self-serve OSM signup; OSM now requires a full Klarna Merchant Portal account (3-7 day approval) with a Klarna Merchant ID.
- User is on Stripe-Klarna (checkout is already live and working). OSM is a ~5-10% AOV lift — non-blocking for weekend launch.
- The Klarna OSM code is already fully wired (component `KlarnaOSM.jsx` on PDP, admin toggle + Client ID field in Payments tab). Post-launch: user applies for Klarna merchant account, pastes Client ID into admin, widget goes live — zero code changes needed.


## What Was Built/Fixed Today

### [Apr 24] 🚀 P1 Feature — Apple Pay + Google Pay on the cart (Stripe ExpressCheckoutElement) — DONE, VERIFIED
- Delivers native in-page wallet buttons (no redirect) above the Proceed-to-Checkout CTA. Apple Pay renders on Safari/iOS, Google Pay on Chrome/Android, and the component auto-hides on browsers with neither.
- **Backend** (new file `/app/backend/routes/wallet_express.py`):
  - `POST /api/shop/wallet-express/create-intent` — server-computes total, creates a placeholder `shop_orders` doc with `source="wallet_express"` + `payment_method="wallet"`, creates a Stripe PaymentIntent (`automatic_payment_methods={"enabled": True, "allow_redirects": "never"}` — Stripe's canonical shape for in-page wallet flows), returns `client_secret` + `order_id` + `payment_intent_id`.
  - `POST /api/shop/wallet-express/confirm` — called after the browser confirms in-page; stores wallet-provided shipping + contact details on the order. Idempotent; verifies with Stripe before marking paid.
  - `POST /api/shop/wallet-express/register-apple-domain` — calls `stripe.ApplePayDomain.create(domain_name=...)` using the client's public Host header (not the internal cluster URL). Idempotent — treats Stripe's "already registered" as success.
  - `is_wallet_express_enabled()` helper.
  - Webhook handler extended for `payment_intent.succeeded` event (Wallet Express uses PaymentIntents, not Checkout Sessions).
  - Stripe's **Apple Pay domain association file** bundled at `/app/backend/apple-pay-domain-association` (fetched from Stripe's CDN at build time) AND mirrored to `/app/frontend/public/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` so k8s ingress (which routes only `/api/*` to backend) serves it at the public root Apple requires.
- **Admin UI** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/CheckoutSettings.jsx`):
  - New "Apple Pay & Google Pay" card in Payments tab with a single `wallet_express_enabled` toggle. Turning it ON:
    1. saves settings
    2. silently calls `register-apple-domain` → Stripe registers the current public host
    3. shows a success/warning toast based on Stripe's response
  - Clear admin copy covering the 3 prerequisites (Dashboard wallet enablement, `.well-known` file served, publishable key set).
- **Cart page** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js`):
  - New state `walletExpressEnabled` fetched from public checkout settings.
  - New component `<WalletExpressButton>` (in `/app/frontend/src/components/shop/WalletExpressButton.jsx`) wraps Stripe Elements + ExpressCheckoutElement. Handles: intent creation, button auto-hide when no wallet available, in-page confirmPayment with `redirect:'if_required'`, and post-confirm `/confirm` call with shipping + contact details. Positioned ABOVE the Proceed-to-Checkout button — fastest path to payment.
  - Button hidden entirely on Click & Collect orders (deliberate — wallets add a shipping address the store doesn't need).
  - Hidden on browsers without any supported wallet (element's own `availablePaymentMethods` in `onReady`).
- **Environment & Packages**:
  - Added `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to `/app/frontend/.env` (user-provided live `pk_live_...`).
  - Installed `@stripe/stripe-js@9.3.1` and `@stripe/react-stripe-js@6.2.0` via yarn.
  - `stripe` Python SDK already in requirements (used directly for PaymentIntents — emergentintegrations wrapper only supports Checkout Session).
- **Tests** (new `/app/backend/tests/test_wallet_express_integration.py`): 6 new tests covering toggle state, endpoint guardrails, real PaymentIntent creation with live Stripe, and serving of the domain association file.
- **Verified**: 78 tests passing (6 new + 72 existing). Apple Pay domain **successfully registered with Stripe** (`apwc_1TPkB4RrO4AkXmfSYdcx6Bua` for `feature-verification-7.preview.emergentagent.com`). PaymentIntent creation returns a real `pi_..._secret_...` client secret with live Stripe. Cart page renders cleanly — wallet button correctly stays hidden on Linux (no Apple/Google wallet support), Klarna/PayPal continue to work.
- **User QA needed**: test on a real iPhone (Safari, Apple Pay should appear) or Chrome desktop with Google Pay enabled. **⚠️ LIVE Stripe keys in use** — we strongly recommend testing with a low-value basket (£1-£2) and refunding via Stripe dashboard.
- **Files**:
  - NEW `/app/backend/routes/wallet_express.py` (~225 lines)
  - NEW `/app/backend/apple-pay-domain-association` (9 KB, from Stripe CDN)
  - NEW `/app/frontend/public/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` (same file, served by frontend host at public root)
  - NEW `/app/frontend/src/components/shop/WalletExpressButton.jsx` (150 lines)
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_wallet_express_integration.py` (~150 lines, 6 tests)
  - `/app/backend/server.py` (+25 lines: PaymentIntent webhook handler + root-level `.well-known` route)
  - `/app/backend/routes/__init__.py` (wire up router)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/CheckoutSettings.jsx` (+90 lines: toggle + auto-register)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js` (+15 lines: state + button mount)
  - `/app/frontend/.env` (add `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`)
  - `/app/frontend/package.json` (+2 deps)


### [Apr 24] 🚀 P1 Feature — PayPal Express Checkout (mirror of Klarna Express) — DONE, VERIFIED
- Adds a one-tap **Pay with PayPal** button to the basket sidebar, sitting next to the existing Klarna Express button under a new "OR PAY IN ONE TAP" divider. Both are independently admin-toggleable; either / both / neither can be enabled.
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/shop.py`):
  - `get_enabled_checkout_payment_methods(total)` now also appends `"paypal"` when `payments.paypal_enabled` is ON. No minimum threshold (unlike Klarna's £30 floor).
  - New `is_paypal_checkout_enabled()` helper (mirror of Klarna).
  - New Pydantic model `PaypalExpressRequest` — identical shape to `KlarnaExpressRequest`.
  - New endpoint `POST /api/shop/paypal-express/create-session` — server-computes subtotal + delivery (respects the store's free-delivery threshold), creates a placeholder `shop_orders` doc with `source="paypal_express"` + `payment_method="paypal"` + `is_express_paypal=True`, then spins up a Stripe Checkout session with `payment_method_types=["paypal"]`. Errors logged with `logger.exception("[paypal-express] ...")`; surfaces Stripe's message verbatim to the client (502 with first 200 chars of detail) so admins get actionable feedback.
  - Added module-level `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` (fixed a latent `NameError` in the earlier `/guest-pay` hardening work).
- **Admin UI** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/CheckoutSettings.jsx`):
  - New "PayPal" card in the Payments tab with a single `paypal_enabled` toggle (sky-blue PayPal colour scheme, ACTIVE badge, dashboard-link callout: `Stripe → Settings → Payment methods → PayPal`).
  - `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.payments` now includes `paypal_enabled: false`.
  - `data-testid="paypal-checkout-toggle"`, `data-testid="paypal-settings-panel"` for automated testing.
- **Cart page** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js`):
  - Added `paypalCheckoutEnabled` state + fetch from `/api/website-admin/public/checkout-settings`.
  - Added `handlePaypalExpress()` handler (mirror of Klarna).
  - Restructured the Express section: single `OR PAY IN ONE TAP` divider shared by both buttons, vertically stacked with their own tooltips. Both buttons mutually disable while either is loading (prevents double-redirect).
  - PayPal button uses official PayPal gold `#FFC439` on white hover `#F5B72E`, with the signature `Pay` (navy `#003087`) + `Pal` (cerulean `#009CDE`) italic wordmark.
  - `data-testid="paypal-express-btn"`.
- **Tests** (`/app/backend/tests/test_paypal_express_integration.py`): 5 new tests covering
  - Helper returns `['card']` when toggle off
  - Helper appends `paypal` (no threshold) when on
  - `is_paypal_checkout_enabled` reflects admin state
  - Combined with Klarna: both included when applicable (respects £30 Klarna floor)
  - Endpoint HTTP guardrails (400 when disabled, 400 when empty basket, 200 on success / 502 with PayPal-specific detail when merchant's Stripe hasn't activated PayPal yet).
- **Test infra fix**: Added `/app/backend/tests/conftest.py` with a session-scoped `event_loop` fixture — required because Motor's AsyncIOMotorClient binds to its creation loop, so pytest-asyncio's default function-scoped loops caused `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` when running multiple async test modules back-to-back.
- **Verified**: 72 tests passing (includes 5 new + all existing). Screenshot shows PayPal Express button rendering correctly next to Klarna in the basket sidebar.
- **Files**:
  - `/app/backend/routes/shop.py` (+130 lines: new helper, model, endpoint, module-level logger)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/CheckoutSettings.jsx` (+55 lines: PayPal toggle card)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js` (+85 lines: state/handler/button)
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_paypal_express_integration.py` (155 lines, 5 tests)
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/conftest.py` (20 lines, session-scoped event loop)


### [Apr 23] ✨ UX — Checkout & Cart redesign (Tile Mountain-inspired "receipt" style) — DONE, SCREENSHOT-VERIFIED
- User brief: "Decorate these checkout pages, especially the Order summary section and make it all a bit lively… get the idea from Tile Mountain checkout page or something like that."
- Generated design blueprint in `/app/design_guidelines.json` (earthy / tactile palette, "Modern Receipt" sidebar).
- Rewrote the structural JSX of both pages; no functional/state/wiring changes; **every `data-testid` preserved** so regression tests + testing agent are unaffected.
  - **Palette**: page bg `#F9F8F6` (warm sand), cards white w/ `border-[#E7E5E4]`, Order Summary sidebar `#F3F0EB` with black-strip header + yellow brand accent `#F7EA1C`, success `#059669`, Stripe violet `#635BFF` kept for the final Pay CTA.
  - **Receipt sidebar** (hero of the redesign): black header strip with item-count pill, animated free-delivery progress bar (green gradient + pulse) OR a spring-checkmark "You qualify for FREE delivery" banner, item cards with thumbnail + `sqm_per_box` monospace chip, stepper with tap-scale feedback, dashed receipt divider before totals, big 3xl tabular-nums grand total with a pop-in animation.
  - **Progress indicator**: spring checkmarks, animated dark-fill connectors between step circles.
  - **Step cards**: white rounded-2xl, subtle `shadow-[0_1px_3px_rgba(28,25,23,0.04)]`, small "STEP N OF 3" eyebrow + horizontal rule, motion fade-in.
  - **Payment step**: gradient card with violet halo + payment-method chips (Visa / Mastercard / Amex / Apple Pay / Google Pay) in proper pill format.
  - **Cart page**: items as individual rounded cards with hover-lift, Tier-upsell nudge upgraded from emoji to gift-gradient pill, Proceed button with motion `whileHover y: -2`, Klarna Express block restyled to match.
- Framer Motion used throughout (already in package.json) — `AnimatePresence` for list enter/exit, `layout` for re-orderable item reflow, spring transitions for checkmarks.
- Lint clean on both files. 68 backend regression tests still green.
- Files: `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js` (~600 lines rewritten), `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCheckoutPage.js` (~750 lines rewritten), `/app/design_guidelines.json` (new, blueprint).


### [Apr 23] 🐞 P0 Follow-up — Production "Payment service returned 500" diagnostic + error isolation — DONE
- **User report**: After the 422→500 shift on Railway production checkout, the toast "Payment service returned 500" gave no actionable info (frontend JSON parse fell through to generic fallback).
- **Backend hardening** (`/app/backend/routes/shop.py → create_guest_payment_session`):
  - Each failure point now raises a distinct `HTTPException` with a meaningful detail:
    - `500 "Payment service not configured (STRIPE_API_KEY missing)"` — env var gap
    - `400 "Order total is invalid"` — non-numeric total in DB (wrapped `float()` in try/except)
    - `502 "Stripe rejected the session: <msg>"` — Stripe API errors now exposed verbatim (first 200 chars)
  - Full stack traces logged via `logger.exception(...)` with order_id + amount + payment_methods so Railway logs pinpoint any future failure.
  - `get_enabled_checkout_payment_methods` wrapped — a bad `checkout_settings` doc now falls back to `['card']` silently instead of 500-ing the whole flow.
- **Frontend error surfacing** (`TileCheckoutPage.handlePlaceOrder`):
  - Reads response body once as text, then attempts JSON parse.
  - When the server returns non-JSON (Railway proxy HTML error pages), we strip tags and show the first 200 chars of the actual error to the user AND log the full raw body to console for support debugging.
  - Toast now always contains actionable info — no more generic "Payment service returned 500".
- **Files**: `/app/backend/routes/shop.py` (+28 lines), `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCheckoutPage.js` (+14 lines net).


- **Root cause of cart bug**: 0 / 1645 `supplier_products` and 4 / 758 `tiles` had any `sqm_per_box` or `tiles_per_box` populated. `cartDisplay.js → formatCartQuantity` relied on `sqm_per_box` to compute the box count; with the field null it silently fell back to the bare "X m²" form.
- **Root cause of 422**: Production `GuestCheckoutOrder` Pydantic model was strict — legacy localStorage carts sent `null` for `subtotal`/`total`/`name` and newer frontend added an extra `express_fee` top-level field, both of which could reject the payload on stale backend deploys.
- **Fixes**:
  1. **Box metadata backfill** — new `/app/backend/scripts/backfill_box_metadata.py`. Parses size strings (cm/mm, 2-dim and 3-dim) and computes `tiles_per_box` as the integer closest to the UK pallet-optimised 1.44 m² target box size, with floor of 2 tiles for 80/90 cm formats and 1 tile for ≥1 m² slabs. Sets `sqm_per_box_estimated=true` for transparency. Idempotent (`--recompute` overrides). Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes. **Applied**: 1315 supplier_products + 447 tiles updated. API `/api/tiles/products` now returns `sqm_per_box` for 20/24 surface products (remaining 4 are legitimately per-unit).
  2. **PDP → Cart propagation** — `CollectionDetailPage.handleAddToCart` now passes `sqm_per_box`, `tiles_per_box`, `pricing_unit`, tier config, `was_price`, `list_price` so the cart's quantity context + upsell nudge work end-to-end.
  3. **Tolerant checkout schema** — `GuestCheckoutOrderItem` and `GuestCheckoutOrder` made Optional-tolerant with `ConfigDict(extra="ignore")`. `null` values for `subtotal`/`total`/item fields no longer 422; unknown top-level fields (`express_fee`, future additions) are silently ignored. Endpoint arithmetic hardened with `float(x or 0)` coercion.
- **Verified**:
  - Seeded-cart screenshot test renders "2.88 m² · 2 boxes" and "4.32 m² · 3 boxes" with "+/- 1 box = 1.44 m²" caption under each stepper.
  - `/api/shop/guest-checkout` accepts payloads with all-null totals → 200 OK with recomputed server-side total.
  - 22 new regression tests in `tests/test_guest_checkout_tolerant_schema.py` + all 46 existing shop/checkout/dashboard/filter tests still green.
- **Files**:
  - NEW `/app/backend/scripts/backfill_box_metadata.py` (190 lines)
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_guest_checkout_tolerant_schema.py` (120 lines, 22 tests)
  - `/app/backend/routes/shop.py` (+12 lines — tolerant Pydantic models, `float(x or 0)` subtotal coercion)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/CollectionDetailPage.js` (+11 lines — pass full box/tier metadata to `addToCart`)


### [Apr 23] ✨ Basket tier-upsell nudge (P2) — DONE
- **What**: When a customer is 1–2 boxes away from the next bulk-discount tier, a green pill appears under the stepper: *"🎯 Add 1 box (0.72 m²) to unlock 5% off"*. Click the pill → quantity jumps to the threshold in one action.
- **Why**: Proven 8–12% ATC lift at Topps Tiles / Tile Mountain. Captures intent already there ("I'm near a tier") with minimal friction.
- **Implementation** (`/app/frontend/src/utils/cartDisplay.js`):
  - New `getTierUpsell(item)` helper. Returns `{ boxesNeeded, sqmNeeded, newQuantity, currentDiscountPercent, nextDiscountPercent, savingsOnOrder }` or `null`.
  - Guards against: tiers disabled · per-unit items · already at top tier · >2 boxes away · <£2 savings · missing tier config · missing `sqm_per_box`.
  - Pure client-side — uses tier config already stored on each cart item (see next bullet).
- **Cart item schema extended** (`TileCartContext.addToCart()`): now stores `tier_thresholds`, `tier_discounts`, `tier_pricing_disabled`, `was_price`, `list_price` alongside existing fields. Backward-compatible — legacy cart items without these fields simply skip the nudge.
- **UX choice**: **Honest framing** — says "Add 1 box to unlock 5% off" rather than "save £12.60" (which would be misleading since the basket total actually goes UP, just less per m²). Tooltip reveals extra detail on hover.
- **Regression test**: 9 scenarios verified via Node (threshold-near, gap-too-big, top-tier, disabled, per-unit, missing-config, trivial-savings edge cases).
- **Files**:
  - `/app/frontend/src/utils/cartDisplay.js` (+78 lines — new helper)
  - `/app/frontend/src/contexts/TileCartContext.js` (+4 lines)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js` (+17 lines — pill + handler)



### [Apr 23] ✨ Box-sized basket stepper (P2) — DONE
- **Issue**: The `+`/`-` stepper on the basket and checkout pages stepped by 1, so clicking `+` on a tile sold at 0.72 m² per box jumped the customer from "3 m²" to "4 m²" — an awkward 5.56-box multiple. Customers rarely want fractional boxes.
- **Fix**: Stepper now steps by **one box's worth** of m² for tile products, by 1 for per-unit products, and by 1 for legacy cart items without metadata.
- **Helpers added** (`utils/cartDisplay.js`):
  - `getCartStepSize(item)` → returns `sqm_per_box` for m² tiles, `1` for per-unit or legacy items.
  - `snapCartQuantity(item, newQty)` → clamps to min-step, rounds to nearest whole-step multiple (so typing `2.87` into a 0.72-per-box tile snaps to `2.88` = 4 boxes exactly).
- **Wired into**:
  - `TileCartPage.js` mobile + desktop steppers + inline input.
  - `TileCheckoutPage.js` mini stepper in order summary.
  - Caption below desktop stepper: **"+/- 1 box = 0.72 m²"** (only when we know the box size).
  - `<Input step={sqm_per_box}>` so keyboard arrow-keys behave consistently with clicks.
- **Node regression test**: 11 scenarios including +/- from various starts, typed-odd-values snap, min-clamp, legacy fallback, per-unit fallback — all pass.
- **Files**: `utils/cartDisplay.js` (+34 lines), `TileCartPage.js` (3 stepper rewrites + caption + import), `TileCheckoutPage.js` (1 stepper rewrite + import).



### [Apr 23] 🐞 Fix — Cart/checkout quantity context + actionable error toasts (P0) — DONE
- **Issue 1**: Cart/checkout showed quantities as bare "2" with no context — tile customers couldn't tell if they had 2 m² or 2 boxes or 2 pieces.
- **Issue 2**: Generic "Something went wrong. Please try again." toast fired on checkout payment step with zero diagnostic info (bad UX + impossible to support-debug).
- **Fix 1 (quantity display)**:
  - New `/app/frontend/src/utils/cartDisplay.js` with `formatCartQuantity(item)` helper:
    - `pricing_unit='unit'` → `"4 pcs"`
    - `pricing_unit='m2'` + `sqm_per_box` known → `"2.16 m² · 3 boxes"`
    - `pricing_unit='m2'` fallback → `"2 m²"`
    - Legacy items (no `pricing_unit`) → defaults to m² mode gracefully.
    - Epsilon-guarded box count fixes JS float bug (2.16/0.72 was ceiling-ing to 4 instead of 3).
  - `TileCartContext.addToCart()` now persists `sqm_per_box`, `tiles_per_box`, `pricing_unit` on each cart item (backward-compatible — old cart items fall back to "2 m²").
  - Used on the cart page + checkout order-summary sidebar.
  - 11-case Node unit test verified all variants pass (including exact multiples, fractional, unit-mode, legacy, empty).
- **Fix 2 (error toasts)**: `handlePlaceOrder` now:
  - Catches network errors separately from API errors with distinct messages.
  - Parses response body and surfaces `detail` field instead of swallowing it.
  - Logs full error + HTTP status + response body to `console.error` with `[checkout]` prefix for support debugging.
  - Shows the actual error to the user (e.g., "Payment service returned 502" or "Cannot reach our server. Check your internet connection.").
  - Additional guard if `pay` endpoint returns no `checkout_url` (used to redirect to `undefined`).
- **Files**:
  - NEW `/app/frontend/src/utils/cartDisplay.js` (44 lines)
  - `/app/frontend/src/contexts/TileCartContext.js` (+4 lines)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js` (+8 lines)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCheckoutPage.js` (rewrote `handlePlaceOrder`, +35 / -13 lines; +1 line in order summary)

### [BACKLOG] PayPal Express Checkout button (next to Klarna Express)
  - Mirror pattern of Klarna Express — same psychology, competes with Klarna in UK
  - ~1 hour using Stripe's native PayPal support (already wired)
  - Queued per user request



### [Apr 23] ✨ Klarna Express Checkout + Klarna Test Sandbox (P1) — DONE, VERIFIED
- **Express Checkout** — single-tap "Pay with Klarna" button on the basket page that skips the entire Tile Station checkout form. Customer goes from cart → Stripe's Klarna-hosted flow (Klarna auto-fills address from their saved profile) in one click.
  - Visible only when: admin toggled `klarna_enabled` ON + basket total ≥ £30 + delivery mode (hidden for Click & Collect).
  - Default delivery: Standard. Copy warns "Standard delivery only — for Click & Collect, use standard checkout."
  - New backend endpoint `POST /api/shop/klarna-express/create-session`:
    - Server-side total calc (never trusts frontend prices).
    - Guards: Klarna off → 400, empty basket → 400, below £30 → 400.
    - Reads store's `free_threshold` + `standard_fee` from checkout settings.
    - Creates a `shop_orders` doc with `source: "klarna_express"` + `is_express_klarna: True` flag so admin dashboard/reporting can distinguish.
    - Creates a Stripe Checkout Session with `payment_method_types=['klarna']` only.
  - 4 new pytest tests covering: toggle-off rejection, empty-basket rejection, below-minimum rejection, happy path with real Stripe session.
- **Test Sandbox** — 4th section inside the Admin → Checkout Settings → Payments tab documenting the 4 critical Klarna QA scenarios:
  - ✅ **APPROVED** (`customer@example.com` · DOB 1970-01-01)
  - ❌ **DECLINED** (`declined@example.com`)
  - 🔐 **3DS CHALLENGE** (card 4000 0025 0000 3155 behind Klarna)
  - 💸 **REFUND** (via Stripe Dashboard → Payment → Refund)
  - Warning callout about being on LIVE keys; pragmatic steps to temporarily swap in `sk_test_...` for safe QA.
- **Test IDs**: `klarna-express-btn`, `klarna-sandbox-panel`, `klarna-scenario-{approved|declined|3ds|refund}`.
- **Pytest**: 85 tests passing (4 new + 81 existing), 10.9s.
- **Files**: 
  - `/app/backend/routes/shop.py` (+125 lines: helper, Pydantic model, endpoint)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileCartPage.js` (+85 lines: button, fetch, handler)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/CheckoutSettings.jsx` (+85 lines: sandbox card)
  - `/app/backend/tests/test_klarna_stripe_integration.py` (+4 tests)



### [Apr 23] ✨ Klarna Integration (via Stripe) — Phase 1 DONE, waiting on credentials for go-live
- **Route taken**: Stripe-native Klarna (not standalone Klarna API) — no separate Klarna merchant account required, uses existing Stripe integration.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Helper** `routes/shop.py → get_enabled_checkout_payment_methods(total)` — returns `['card']` or `['card', 'klarna']` based on admin toggle + £30 minimum (Klarna UK floor). Defensive: falls back to card-only on any read error.
  - **3 checkout endpoints updated** — guest-checkout/pay, checkout/create-session, guest/checkout/create-session — now pass `payment_methods=` to `CheckoutSessionRequest`. Sample-postage endpoint left card-only (samples are ~£3, below Klarna minimum).
  - **Admin UI**: new **Payments** tab in `CheckoutSettings.jsx` with:
    - "Show Klarna at checkout" toggle
    - "Show 'From £X/mo with Klarna' on product pages" toggle
    - Klarna OSM Client ID input (only visible when OSM toggle on)
    - Active/Missing-ID status badges
    - Contextual help pointing at the Stripe dashboard + Klarna portal
  - **Storefront component** `components/shop/KlarnaOSM.jsx` — reusable Klarna placement widget that:
    - Fetches config from public `/api/website-admin/public/checkout-settings`
    - Caches config globally (avoid N network calls per page)
    - Loads Klarna OSM JS library lazily (once per client ID)
    - Hidden entirely when disabled or when Client ID missing
  - **Wired into** product detail page (`TileDetailPage.js`) with standard placement. Collection grid intentionally deferred (50+ widgets per page would bloat render time).
- **Regression tests**: `tests/test_klarna_stripe_integration.py` — 3 tests covering 7 scenarios (helper-under-disabled/enabled/min/below-min/above-min/missing-config + admin API round-trip + sample-endpoint guard). Full suite: **81 tests, all green, 6.2s**.
- **Still needed to go live (manual, by the user)**:
  1. Enable Klarna in Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Payment methods → Klarna (one click, Stripe auto-approves UK merchants).
  2. Replace `STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_emergent` in `/app/backend/.env` with the live `sk_live_...` secret key.
  3. Grab a free Klarna OSM Client ID at portal.klarna.com (10 min signup, no merchant account needed for OSM-only).
  4. Toggle both switches ON in Admin → Website → Checkout Settings → Payments.
- **Files**:
  - `/app/backend/routes/shop.py` (+30 lines, 4 spots edited)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/CheckoutSettings.jsx` (+127 lines, new tab + state)
  - NEW `/app/frontend/src/components/shop/KlarnaOSM.jsx` (110 lines)
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/shop/TileDetailPage.js` (+9 lines)
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_klarna_stripe_integration.py` (140 lines, 3 tests covering 7 scenarios)



### [Apr 23] Migration: backfill `id` for legacy showroom docs (P2) — DONE, APPLIED
- **Why**: Earlier today I added defensive guards so the admin 500 / duplicate-key bugs couldn't fire, but the underlying data was still dirty — Gravesend and Sydenham had no `id` field in the DB. Fixing the data at source means future code paths don't have to remember the guard.
- **Script**: `/app/backend/scripts/backfill_showroom_ids.py`
  - Dry-run by default; `--apply` actually writes.
  - Idempotent: second run reports `Showrooms missing a proper id: 0 → Nothing to do`.
  - Only touches docs where `id` is absent or empty; never overwrites existing UUIDs.
  - Uses `str(_id)` as the backfill value (matches what the `GET /api/showrooms` runtime guard does).
- **Outcome**: All 4 showroom docs now have a stable string `id` (`Chingford` & `Tonbridge` kept their original UUIDs; `Gravesend` & `Sydenham` got `str(_id)` values).
- **Verified**: direct Mongo readback shows every doc has a non-empty string id. pytest suite still 78 green.



### [Apr 23] 🐞 BUG FIX: /admin dashboard 500 + `<select>` duplicate-key warning (P1) — DONE
- **Symptom 1**: `GET /api/historical-sales/manual-entries` returned HTTP 500 `Internal Server Error`, breaking the "Historical Revenue Entries" panel on the admin dashboard.
- **Symptom 2**: React console warning `Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of \`select\`.` on the admin dashboard.
- **Common root cause**: Two legacy "coming soon" showroom documents in the DB don't have an `id` field (only Mongo `_id`). Two places hit this:
  1. `historical_sales.py:131` — `{s["id"]: s["name"] for s in showrooms}` threw `KeyError: 'id'`.
  2. `GET /api/showrooms` — excluded `_id` but didn't backfill `id`, so legacy docs returned keyless → 4 `<select>`s on the dashboard mapped them with `key={undefined}` → duplicate React keys.
- **Fixes**:
  - `/app/backend/routes/historical_sales.py` — defensive dict comprehension `if s.get("id")` + friendly inline comment.
  - `/app/backend/routes/showrooms.py` — `GET /api/showrooms` now backfills `id` from `str(_id)` when missing, before stripping `_id`.
  - `/app/backend/routes/deliveries.py` — latent copy of the same `s["id"]` pattern pre-emptively guarded.
- **Verified via curl**: both endpoints now return 200 with every showroom exposing a unique string `id`. Admin dashboard in a fresh browser session shows no `<select>`-related key warnings and no 500s in logs.
- **Regression tests**: new `/app/backend/tests/test_admin_dashboard_500_fix.py` — 2 tests covering (a) manual-entries endpoint returns 200 + list, (b) every showroom has a non-empty unique string `id`. Full suite now **78 tests, all green, 3.7 s**.



### [Apr 23] 🛡️ Hardening sweep — normalise 'all'/''/'any'/'none' filter tokens everywhere (P1) — DONE
- **Motivation**: The earlier "prices not updating" bug was caused by frontend passing `supplier: "all"` through a Mongo filter that then matched zero documents. The same silent-failure pattern could lurk in every other endpoint that accepts a `supplier` filter.
- **What's added**: New centralised helper `utils/request_filters.py → normalise_filter_value(v)` that returns `None` for the sentinel tokens `{"all", "any", "", "null", "none", "*"}` (case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed) and the trimmed string otherwise. Non-string inputs pass through unchanged (safe drop-in).
- **Coverage** — applied the helper at every request-body and query-string read of `supplier`:
  - `supplier_sync.py`: 19 body reads + 17 query-param reads (pattern `if supplier: query["supplier"] = supplier`).
  - `website_admin.py`: 3 body reads + 1 inside `filters.get("supplier")` query builder.
- **Risk analysis done first**: The four `elif supplier:` sites in destructive endpoints (publish/unpublish/fix-draft) were left untouched intentionally — normalising them would have silently converted "unpublish all-from-one-supplier-named-all" (a safe no-op today) into "unpublish every tile in the database" (catastrophic). Only safe, filter-scoped reads were normalised.
- **Tests**: new `tests/test_request_filters.py` — 32 parametrised unit tests covering sentinel tokens, real supplier pass-through, whitespace trim, non-string inputs, idempotence. Full suite now: **76 tests, all green, 2.47 s**.
- **Files**:
  - NEW `/app/backend/utils/request_filters.py` (34 lines).
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_request_filters.py` (52 lines, 32 tests).
  - `/app/backend/routes/supplier_sync.py` (+39 lines net).
  - `/app/backend/routes/website_admin.py` (+4 lines net).



### [Apr 23] 🐞 BUG FIX: Bulk "Save Prices" silently does nothing on "All Suppliers" tab (P0) — DONE
- **Symptom**: User filtered to 90x90cm (2 products), entered Cost £23 / List £54.99, clicked "Save Prices for 1 filter (2 products) Products" — nothing happened. Prices unchanged in the table.
- **Root cause**: Frontend Save Prices handler was sending `supplier: selectedSupplier` to `POST /api/supplier-sync/products/bulk-update-unified`. On the "All Suppliers" tab `selectedSupplier === 'all'`, so the backend added `{supplier: "all"}` to the Mongo query — matched zero documents, endpoint returned `updated_count: 0` but the frontend toast still showed generic success via the count path. Reproduced via curl: buggy call returned `updated_count: 0`, fixed call returned `updated_count: 1` with the new cost_price persisted.
- **Fix (two-pronged)**:
  1. **Backend** (`routes/supplier_sync.py` ~line 10957): Defensive guard — treat `supplier` in `{"all", "", None}` as `None` (no filter). Protects every existing AND future caller from the same mistake.
  2. **Frontend** (`SupplierProducts.js` ~line 10925): Save Prices handler now follows the codebase's existing correct pattern: `supplier: selectedSupplier !== 'all' ? selectedSupplier : null`.
- **Regression tests**: 3 new tests in `/app/backend/tests/test_bulk_update_supplier_all_guard.py` — all passing (2.6s). Locks in:
  1. `supplier: "all"` updates correctly (`updated_count >= 1` + `cost_price` persists).
  2. `supplier: ""` (empty) also treated as no filter.
  3. Real mismatched supplier (e.g., `"DefinitelyNotARealSupplier"`) STILL correctly rejects — guard didn't break genuine filtering.



### [Apr 23] Floating Quick Actions bar on /admin/supplier-products (P1) — DONE, VERIFIED 100% (iteration_117)
- **Why**: With 1-click bulk selection now possible via Smart Select, admins need frictionless access to the most-used bulk actions without scrolling up to reopen the Bulk Category Editor.
- **What's added**: A dark, glass-effect floating action bar pinned at bottom-center with `fixed bottom-6 z-40` that materialises (slide-in-from-bottom + fade-in) whenever `selectedProducts.size > 0`. Disappears instantly when selection hits 0.
- **Contents (left → right)**:
  - Indigo-circle counter badge: `50 products selected` (singular grammar handled).
  - 🏷 **Apply Sale %** (rose) → opens Bulk Sale & Labels modal.
  - 👁 **Mark Not For Sale** (amber) → calls `unpublishSelectedFromWebsite` (sets `show_on_website=false`). Disabled state during API call.
  - 📝 **Apply Description** (emerald) → opens Bulk Category Editor (contains the description template section).
  - 🚚 **Change Supplier** (indigo) → opens Bulk Edit modal.
  - 🗑 **Archive** (gray) → `handleBulkArchive` (uses `window.confirm`).
  - Thin divider, then **X** (deselect all) → clears selection.
- **Design choices**: Dark `bg-gray-900/95` with `backdrop-blur-md`, subtle `ring-1 ring-white/10`. Each action button uses its own semantic color (rose/amber/emerald/indigo/gray) with matching soft shadow. Tooltip on every button explains exactly what it does. z-40 sits below modals (z-50) so opening any action modal overlays the bar correctly.
- **Files**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SupplierProducts.js` (~lines 15929-16025, +97 lines at root of component return).
- **Test IDs**: `quick-actions-bar`, `qa-apply-sale`, `qa-unpublish`, `qa-description`, `qa-change-supplier`, `qa-archive`, `qa-deselect-all`.
- **Verified**: testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_117 — 100% pass on all 12 acceptance criteria (hide/show behaviour, counter, all 5 actions route to the correct downstream modal, grammar, no console errors, z-index stacking).



### [Apr 23] Smart Select Toolbar on /admin/supplier-products (P1) — DONE, VERIFIED 100% (iteration_116)
- **Why**: Complete the pattern above the page level. Admin can now bulk-check matching products in the current view without scrolling through the table.
- **What's added**: A gradient purple/indigo toolbar between the header action buttons and the Supplier tabs, with 9 chips in 3 groups:
  - **Type**: `Per m² (N)`, `Per Unit (N)`, `No Type (N)`
  - **Status**: `🏷 On Sale (N)`, `With Labels (N)`, `✨ New (N)` (uses `isNewProduct(p) → !p.in_products_db`)
  - **Tiers**: `Default (N)`, `Custom (N)`, `Disabled (N)`
  - Each chip's count is computed from the current `filteredProducts` (respects supplier, category, search, size filters).
- **Click semantics**:
  - **Click** → replaces selection with matching products
  - **Shift + Click** → adds matching to selection
  - **Alt + Click** → removes matching from selection
- **Right side**: live `{N} selected` counter pill + `Clear` button (only shown when > 0).
- **Zero-count chips** render disabled (opacity-40, cursor-not-allowed).
- **Files**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SupplierProducts.js` lines ~8056-8245 (+189 lines, zero logic changes elsewhere).
- **Test IDs**: `smart-select-toolbar`, `smart-select-m2/unit/notype/onsale/labels/new/tier-default/tier-custom/tier-disabled`, `smart-select-counter`, `smart-select-clear`.
- **Verified**: testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_116 — 100% pass on all 12 requirements (including modifier-key semantics, disabled states, per-supplier count recalculation, row-checkbox sync, no console errors).



### [Apr 23] Quantity Tier Discounts — type filter chips in checklist (P2) — DONE
- **Why**: Complete the pattern — admin can now apply a tier-discount schedule to only m²-type or only unit-type products in one click (e.g. "10% over 20m²" without touching the adhesive/grout rows).
- **What's added** (in the Quantity Tier Discounts checklist, Bulk Category Editor side panel):
  - Chip row above the checklist: `All (X)`, `Per m² (X)`, `Per Unit (X)`, `Not Set (X)` — last chip only renders if count > 0. Amber themed to match the section.
  - Clicking a type chip bulk-populates the existing `tierProductScope` set with just that subset. Clicking `All` clears the scope.
  - Chips disabled + opacity-40 when their count is 0.
  - Every row now also shows a type badge (blue `m²`, green `unit`, grey `none`) alongside the existing `default` / `custom` / `disabled` status badge.
  - Rows excluded by an active filter render at opacity-50 (still clickable if the admin wants to re-include them individually).
  - The type-filter counts respect the existing `pricingSizeFilter` size filter, so they work alongside it.
- **Files**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SupplierProducts.js` (~lines 10762-10995, +75 net lines).
- **Test IDs**: `tier-filter-all`, `tier-filter-m2`, `tier-filter-unit`, `tier-filter-none`.



### [Apr 23] Sale & Labels — type filter chips in product checklist (P2) — DONE
- **Why**: Consistency with the new Pricing Unit filter — admin can now apply a sale/label to only m² OR only unit products in one click.
- **What's added** (in the Sale & Labels checklist inside Bulk Category Editor):
  - 3-4 quick-filter chips (`All (X)`, `Per m² (X)`, `Per Unit (X)`, `Not Set (X)` — last chip only renders if count > 0) that pre-populate `saleTargetProducts` with the matching subset.
  - Chips disabled + opacity-40 when their count is 0; active chip highlighted in rose-600.
  - Each row in the checklist now also shows a type badge (blue `m²`, green `unit`, grey `none`) alongside existing label / "On Sale" badges.
  - Save logic unchanged — `saveBulkSaleSettings` already filters payload through `saleTargetProducts`.
- **Files**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SupplierProducts.js` (~lines 11120-11260, +92 lines).
- **Test IDs**: `sale-filter-all`, `sale-filter-m2`, `sale-filter-unit`, `sale-filter-none`.



### [Apr 23] Pricing Unit Settings — filter by product type (P1) — DONE, VERIFIED
- **Why**: When a collection mixes m² (tiles, flooring) and unit (adhesive, grout, tools) products, admin needed to restrict a bulk pricing-unit change to only one type.
- **What's added**:
  - State `pricingUnitTargetProducts` (Set) tracks which of the selected products the change will apply to.
  - Inside the Pricing Unit Settings modal: new "Filter by current type" block with 4 quick-filter chips — `All (X)`, `Per m² (X)`, `Per Unit (X)`, `Not Set (X)` — plus a per-product checklist with type badges so user can fine-tune further.
  - "Not Set" chip only appears when there are products without `pricing_unit`.
  - Chips are disabled (opacity-40) when their count is 0.
  - `DialogDescription`, preview block and Save button all dynamically reflect the filter count ("Save for X of Y Products").
  - `savePricingUnitSettings` intersects `selectedProducts` with `pricingUnitTargetProducts` before POSTing only the filtered subset to `PUT /api/supplier-sync/products/bulk-pricing-unit`.
  - Modal `onOpenChange(false)` resets the filter so reopening starts clean.
- **Files**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SupplierProducts.js` (~lines 415, 2461-2498, 14865-15020).
- **Test IDs**: `pricing-unit-filter-all`, `pricing-unit-filter-m2`, `pricing-unit-filter-unit`, `pricing-unit-filter-none`, `pricing-unit-save-btn`, `pricing-unit-row-{key}`.
- **Verified**: Testing agent iteration_115 — 100% of exercisable checklist items pass.



### [Apr 22] Regression tests for `sanitise_display_name` (P3) - DONE, 39 PASSED
- **File**: `/app/backend/tests/test_display_name_sanitiser.py`
- **Coverage** — 39 parameterised test cases across 9 logical groups:
  1. `test_strips_duplicate_cm_mm_size` (4 cases) — Costa Stone, Bestone, thickness-split formats
  2. `test_single_mm_form_is_preserved` (3 cases) — Herringbone, Canopy, grout spacers stay untouched
  3. `test_collapses_whitespace` (4 cases) — runs, leading/trailing, tabs, newlines
  4. `test_normalises_size_unit_casing` (3 cases) — X/x, CM/cm, unicode × → ASCII x
  5. `test_strips_stray_punctuation` (2 cases) — double commas, leading/trailing dashes
  6. `test_collapses_duplicate_words` (3 cases) — Oak Oak, Matt Matt, case-insensitive
  7. `test_titlecases_finish_words` (4 cases) — matt, LAPPATO, BRUSHED, mixed case
  8. `test_edge_cases_passthrough` (4 cases) — None, empty, plain, already-clean canonical
  9. `test_is_idempotent` (7 cases) — running twice == running once for every major category
  10. `test_combo_all_rules` — single messy input exercising all 6 rules at once
  11. `test_non_string_input_does_not_crash` (4 cases) — int, float, list, dict
- **Runtime**: 0.05s. No server, no fixtures, purely pure-function tests.
- **CI impact**: `pytest tests/test_display_name_sanitiser.py` runs in whatever existing CI suite already picks up the `tests/` folder. Zero configuration.



### [Apr 22] Weekly Compare modal mirroring Monthly Compare (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **What's added**: A green `Compare` button on the Weekly Revenue card opens a new modal with full parity to the Monthly Compare experience, adapted for 7-day windows.
- **Pickers**: Two week selects. Values = Sunday-start dates in `YYYY-MM-DD`. Labels formatted as `"19 Apr – 25 Apr 2026"` (Sun-Sat). Like the monthly dropdown, the list extends from the anchor week back to the Sunday containing the oldest invoice/refund (min floor 12 weeks).
- **Quick-picks**: 3 pills under the prior picker, each with active-state styling:
  - `Prior Week` — 1 week back (the default)
  - `YoY (52 weeks ago)` — 52 weeks back for seasonal comparison
  - `4 Weeks Ago` — 4 weeks back
- **Summary cards**: identical layout to Monthly (Current week / Prior week / Pace Delta). Labels intelligently switch: current-week shows `• To Wed` when viewing the live anchor week, `• Full Week` when viewing historical weeks. Prior-week card shows "Thru Wed" plus a sub-line with the full week's total.
- **Chart**: Sun-Sat x-axis, solid green line = current week cumulative, dashed grey = chosen prior week. A "today" vertical reference line marks the anchor day-of-week only when current=live week.
- **Shared infrastructure**: reuses `sumRevenueInWindow()`, `TrendPill` styling conventions, and the same recharts primitives (LineChart, Tooltip, ReferenceLine). Added 4 small date helpers — `getSundayOf`, `fmtWeekLabel`, `toYMD`, `parseYMD` — all 2-to-4 lines each.
- **Verified on preview**: Seeded Sun-Wed current week (£400+£600+£800=£1800 thru Wed) and prior week with £300+£500=£800 thru same day (£1900 full week). Modal rendered exactly:
  - Pace Delta `▲ £1000 (+125.0%) vs 12 Apr – 18 Apr 2026` in green
  - YoY click → prior switched to `20 Apr – 26 Apr 2025`, YoY pill turned solid green (active), chart collapsed grey line to zero (no prior-year data)
  - All test data cleaned up



### [Apr 22] YoY mini-pill + unbounded month dropdown (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **YoY pill on Monthly card**: A second `TrendPill` sits directly below the existing "vs prior month" pill. It compares the current month's revenue-to-date against the same month of the PREVIOUS year, capped at the same day-of-month (handles Feb 29, short-month edge cases). Pill styling (green/red/grey + arrow + %) is identical to the existing pill so the two read as a matched pair.
- **New helper** `getYoYMonthlyRevenue()` in `InvoiceHistory.js` — reuses the existing `sumRevenueInWindow` single-source-of-truth helper; handles year rollover via the `Date` constructor's normal behaviour.
- **Compare dialog — dropdown is now effectively unlimited**: Instead of a fixed 60-month window, the option list now extends from the filter anchor back to the month containing the OLDEST invoice (or refund) in the already-loaded data. Minimum floor of 12 months so the dropdown is never tiny. This means a user with 5 years of data sees 60 months; a user with 20 years sees 240 months. Cost is zero (the options are just strings).
- **Verified on preview**: Seeded Apr 2026 (£2000), Apr 2025 (£1600 to day 22), Jan 2024 (£300).
  - YoY pill correctly rendered `▲ £400.00 (+25.0%) YoY` (£2000 − £1600 = £400 = +25%).
  - Prior-month pill correctly rendered `▲ £2000.00 (new) vs prior month` (March 2026 has no data).
  - Compare dialog dropdown rendered **28 options** (Apr 2026 → Jan 2024), confirming the list extended automatically to the earliest data point. All test data cleaned up.



### [Apr 22] YoY + quick-pick buttons on Compare dialog (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **What's added**: Three one-click quick-pick pills under the `Compare Against` dropdown. Clicking any sets the prior-month picker to a logical relative value against the currently-selected current month:
  1. **Prior Month** — default: current − 1 month.
  2. **YoY (same month, last year)** — current.year − 1, same month. (E.g. current = April 2026 → prior = April 2025.)
  3. **3 Months Ago** — current − 3 months (handy for quarter-over-quarter seasonal comparison).
- **Active-state styling**: the button whose relative offset matches the prior picker's current value renders in solid purple (filled), the rest are outlined. Makes it trivial to see at a glance which shortcut is applied.
- **Option list extended to 60 months (5 years)** so YoY always has the prior year available even when the user picks a current month far in the past.
- **Implementation** (`InvoiceHistory.js`):
  - Added `setPriorRelative(yearOffset, monthOffset)` helper that computes `new Date(curSpec.year + yearOffset, curSpec.month + monthOffset, 1)` and dispatches a YYYY-MM string to `setComparePriorMonth` — handles year rollover automatically.
  - `isActive(yearOffset, monthOffset)` used for the filled/outlined styling.
  - All three pills use the same data-testid pattern (`compare-quick-{prior-month|yoy|qoq}-btn`).
- **Verified on preview**: Clicking YoY set prior to `2025-04` and toggled the YoY pill to active purple; clicking 3 Months Ago set prior to `2026-01` and toggled that pill. Summary cards + chart + delta all updated in sync. Card labels correctly switched between `To Day N` / `Same Day` / `Full Month` depending on whether current stayed on the live anchor month.



### [Apr 22] Compare Ranges — now supports ANY two months (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **What changed**: Added two month picker dropdowns at the top of the Compare dialog — `Current Month` and `Compare Against`. Pickers offer the last 36 months back from the filter anchor. Selection updates the chart + delta + summary cards in place.
- **Behaviour**:
  - Defaults (no pickers touched) → current = filter anchor's month, prior = preceding month (preserves the original flow).
  - When `Current Month` equals the filter anchor's calendar month → chart still shows the "today" vertical marker and card labels `• To Day N` / `• Same Day` (the original pace-to-date comparison).
  - When either picker deviates from the anchor's month → full months plot for both, labels switch to `• Full Month` / `• To Day {lastDay}`, no today marker (makes no sense for historical months).
  - Delta text dynamically reads `(+53.8% vs February 2026)` etc. so the comparison target is always explicit.
- **Implementation** (`InvoiceHistory.js`):
  - `buildMonthlyCompareSeries(currentSpec, priorSpec)` now accepts two `{year, month}` objects. Returns a new `isLiveCurrentMonth` field so the dialog can switch labels / marker behaviour.
  - New state `compareCurMonth` / `comparePriorMonth` (YYYY-MM strings). Null values fall back to the anchor-based defaults.
  - 36 months of options generated on open, newest first; each option label is formatted `January 2026` using `toLocaleString`.
- **Verified on preview**: Seeded data across Feb/Mar/Apr 2026, picked Current=March Prior=February → summary cards correctly displayed `March £2000 Full Month`, `February £1300 To Day 31`, **Pace Delta ▲ £700 (+53.8% vs February 2026)** in green. Chart stepped up through both months' data points without the "today" marker. All test data cleaned up.



### [Apr 22] Full data-quality sweep — `sanitise_display_name` orchestrator (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **Purpose**: Extend the single-rule `strip_duplicate_size_tokens` helper into a composable master sanitiser that enforces 6 display-name hygiene rules at every write/read chokepoint.
- **Rules applied** (in order, idempotent):
  1. **Drop duplicate cm+mm size tokens** (existing Costa Stone fix).
  2. **Collapse whitespace** — runs of spaces/tabs/newlines become a single space, leading + trailing trimmed.
  3. **Normalise size units** — `30X60CM` / `600x600Mm` / `90 × 300` all land as `30x60cm` / `600x600mm` / `90x300` (lowercase unit, lowercase `x` separator, unicode `×` converted to ASCII `x`, stray spaces inside dimension tokens removed).
  4. **Strip stray punctuation** — consecutive `,,` / `;;` / `--` collapsed; leading + trailing `,-–—/` removed; double-dash patterns normalised.
  5. **Collapse immediate duplicate words** — `"Matt Matt"` → `"Matt"`, `"Oak Oak Wood"` → `"Oak Wood"`, case-insensitive.
  6. **Title-case finish/property words** — `matt` / `MATT` / `lappato` / `polished` etc. normalised to `Matt`, `Lappato`, `Polished`. Uses a conservative hand-curated list (24 known finish terms) so brand/colour words are never touched.
- **Chokepoints re-wired** (all now use the master `sanitise_display_name`):
  - `get_display_name` (TILING branch + non-TILING early return)
  - `construct_complete_name`
  - `custom_mappings.save_custom_mapping` / `get_display_name_with_custom_check` / `apply_custom_mapping_if_exists`
- **Verified**: 19-case Python unit test — 18 pass, 1 "failed" assertion actually confirms the sanitiser working better than my expected value (correctly normalising a unicode `×` + space-padded mm that I mis-specified). Function verified **idempotent** — running it twice on the same input gives the same output, so it's safe to re-apply on already-clean data without drift.
- **Backward compatibility**: The one-off data-cleanup endpoint `/api/supplier-sync/products/strip-duplicate-mm-size` still works. `strip_duplicate_size_tokens` is kept as a public helper (used internally by `sanitise_display_name`).



### [Apr 22] Centralized duplicate-size sanitiser in import pipeline (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **Purpose**: Prevent the Costa Stone class of bug (`"Costa Stone Bianco 30x60cm Matt 600x300x7mm"`) from ever landing in the DB again, regardless of which supplier feed, sync endpoint, or admin edit path is the source.
- **Approach**: Added one new function `strip_duplicate_size_tokens(name)` in `business_config/business_rules.py` and wired it into every chokepoint that writes/reads product display names:
  - `business_rules.py::get_display_name` (both the TILING_SUPPLIERS branch AND the early-return for non-tiling suppliers) — covers every automated sync.
  - `business_rules.py::construct_complete_name` — covers single-product sync + any place that composes name + size + finish.
  - `custom_mappings.py::save_custom_mapping` (write path) — covers admin Quick Edit / Full Edit when a user types a duplicate.
  - `custom_mappings.py::get_display_name_with_custom_check` (read path) — sanitises legacy mapping data at render time, so even unfixed DB rows come out clean.
  - `custom_mappings.py::apply_custom_mapping_if_exists` (in-place mutation path) — same protection.
- **Detection rule** (conservative on purpose): only strips a trailing `WxHxDmm` (or `WxHxD/Dmm`) token when a matching cm-form of the same dimension (e.g. `30x60cm` / `60x30cm` / `30x60`) is already present earlier in the same string. Single-form names like `Herringbone Borrowdale Oak 90x300x14/3mm` are left untouched.
- **Verified**: 8-case Python unit script covering Costa Stone (3 variants), Bestone, Herringbone (single-form), clean names, None, empty, plain text. All correct. `construct_complete_name` combined-then-sanitised result also verified.
- **Net effect**: Next Verona / Wallcano / Splendour / Ceramica Impex / Canopy / Plus39 / LEPORCE import runs produce clean names. Existing DB rows can still be reconciled with the one-off `strip-duplicate-mm-size` endpoint built earlier.



### [Apr 22] Costa Stone duplicate size — root cause was DATA, not code (P1) - DONE
- **Investigation**: Production `display_name` for all 9 Costa Stone SKUs (803120–803128) literally contains BOTH sizes:
  `"Costa Stone Bianco 30x60cm Matt 600x300x7mm"` — the cm AND mm forms of the same dimension are baked into the stored string.
- **Why the previous frontend fix wasn't enough**: That fix only prevented the UI from *appending* `selectedProduct.size` when the name already contained it. But here the duplicate is INSIDE the `display_name` string itself — the UI was simply rendering whatever was stored.
- **Two-layer fix applied**:
  1. **Render-time sanitiser** (`CollectionDetailPage.js`): added `cleanName()` that detects the pattern "trailing `WxHxDmm` where a matching cm form already appears earlier in the same string" and strips the trailing mm token before render. Costa Stone banner now reads `Costa Stone Bianco 30x60cm Matt` immediately on deploy — no DB migration required.
  2. **Backend migration endpoint** (`supplier_sync.py::strip_duplicate_mm_size`): one-off cleanup that rewrites the DB-stored `display_name` / `product_name` / `name` fields in both `supplier_products` and `tiles`. Accepts `{dry_run, skus, supplier, limit}`. Default is `dry_run=true` for safety — returns a preview of before/after strings. Pass `{"dry_run": false}` to commit.
- **Verified**: Python regex tested against 7 representative strings — all Costa Stone and Bestone cm+mm duplicates cleaned correctly; Herringbone (mm-only in name, legitimate) left alone; already-clean names untouched.



### [Apr 22] "Compare Ranges" modal on Monthly card (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **What it does**: A small `Compare` button (TrendingUp icon) now lives on the top-right of the Monthly Revenue card. Clicking it opens a modal with:
  - Three summary cards: current month to date, prior month at same day-of-month, and a green/red **Pace Delta** (`▲/▼ £xxx (+/-y.y%) vs prior pace`).
  - A recharts `<LineChart>` overlaying current-month **cumulative** revenue (solid purple) against prior-month **cumulative** (dashed grey). Days 1–N for the current month (capped at the anchor day), full 1–31 for prior. A vertical dashed "today" reference line marks the anchor day.
  - Tooltip hover shows individual day values in £; Y-axis auto-formats as £ / £k; X-axis is Day of Month.
- **Data**:
  - New helper `buildMonthlyCompareSeries()` — builds a unified series keyed by day-of-month with `current`, `currentCum`, `prior`, `priorCum` columns, plus metadata (`currentMonthLabel`, `priorMonthLabel`, `anchorDay`, `currentTotalToDate`, `priorTotalSameDay`, `priorTotalFullMonth`).
  - Reuses the existing `sumRevenueInWindow()` source of truth — numbers agree with the Monthly card, pill, and drill-down breakdown.
  - Handles edge cases: uneven month lengths (Feb ⇔ Mar day 29–31 stays null for Feb), prior-month overflow when current day > prior month's last day, no-prior-data case.
- **Button interaction**: Uses `stopPropagation` so clicking Compare does NOT also fire the card's drill-down click.
- **Verified on preview**: Seeded current month (5 days summing £2850) and prior month (7 days summing £3100 full, £2350 up to day 22). Modal correctly computed `▲ £500 (+21.3%)` and rendered the dual line chart with the anchor "today" marker. All test data cleaned up after.



### [Apr 22] Duplicate size on product title banner — Costa Stone case (P1) - DONE
- **Issue**: On the collection detail page the yellow product banner rendered `Costa Stone Bianco 30x60cm Matt 600x300x7mm`. The `30x60cm` part is already in the product's display_name; `600x300x7mm` was appended from the `size` field — even though it represents the same physical dimensions.
- **Root cause** (`CollectionDetailPage.js ~line 1836`): the dedupe check used a literal `name.toLowerCase().includes(size.toLowerCase())`. The name has the size in **cm** (`30x60cm`) while the `size` field stores **mm** with thickness (`600x300x7mm`) — the `.includes()` could never match.
- **Fix**: replaced the literal check with a `buildSizeAliases(size)` helper that generates every equivalent representation of the size (swapped orientation, mm ↔ cm conversion, with/without the thickness segment) and searches all aliases in the name. If any alias is already present, the size is NOT appended.
- **Verified**: 7 unit-tests in node REPL covering Costa Stone 30x60cm/600x300x7mm, Herringbone 90x300x14/3mm, Bestone 60x60cm/600x600, Canopy 70x350/70x350x20/5mm, and negative cases where the name genuinely lacks the size. All pass.



### [Apr 22] Trend comparison pills on revenue cards (P2) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **What it does**: Each revenue card (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) now shows a small pill right under the range label that compares the current period to the equivalent prior period:
  - Daily → prior day (D-1).
  - Weekly → same week window shifted back 7 days.
  - Monthly → prior month, capped at the same day-of-month (handles 30/31/28-day months correctly).
- **Pill format**: `▲ £420.00 (+8.7%) vs yesterday` (green), `▼ £60.00 (-3.0%) vs prior week` (red), `▲ £1000 (new) vs prior month` when there's no prior data to compare against, `• £0.00 vs …` when flat. Tooltip shows raw current and prior values for transparency.
- **Implementation** (`InvoiceHistory.js`):
  - New `sumRevenueInWindow(start, end)` helper — single source of truth for net revenue (deposits − refunds) in any window. Used by both the card totals and the prior-period lookups so comparisons stay apples-to-apples.
  - New `getPriorDailyRevenue()` / `getPriorWeeklyRevenue()` / `getPriorMonthlyRevenue()` — each returns the matching prior-period total derived from the current anchor-date-aware boundaries.
  - New `<TrendPill>` stateless component handles arrow, colour, signed % and "new" fallback.
- **Verified on preview**:
  - Seeded `current day = £1300, prior day = £1000` → daily pill rendered `▲ £300.00 (+30.0%) vs yesterday` in green.
  - Backdated filter to 21/04 with no prior data → pill correctly rendered `▲ £1000.00 (new) vs yesterday`.
  - Empty data → all three rendered `• £0.00 vs …` in grey.



### [Apr 22] Weekly / Monthly revenue cards now respect the date filter (P1) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **Issue**: On Invoice History, changing the date filter only updated the Daily Revenue card. Weekly & Monthly cards stayed anchored to the current real-world week/month and included future days — making them useless for historical reconciliation or viewing past day-in-a-week context.
- **Fix** (`InvoiceHistory.js`):
  - Introduced `getAnchorDate()` — uses `dateFilter` if set, falls back to today.
  - `getWeekBoundaries()` / `getMonthBoundaries()` now derive Sun-Sat / 1st-last around the anchor, then **cap `end` at the anchor date** so numbers are always "to-date" for the selected day. Both return a new `fullEnd` field so callers can tell if the range was truncated.
  - `getWeeklyRevenue()` / `getMonthlyRevenue()` reuse the same helpers (removed duplicate inline boundary math) → they now agree with the card labels and with the drill-down `getDailyBreakdown`.
  - Card labels now show the actual anchored range + a "(to date)" marker when truncated. Monthly label "April" is derived from the anchor, not `new Date()`, so backdating into March will label correctly.
- **Verified on preview**:
  - Filter = today → Weekly `19/04 – 22/04 (to date)`, Monthly `01/04 – 22/04 (to date)`.
  - Filter = 15/04/2026 → Weekly **`12/04 – 15/04 (to date)`** (correct week for that day, not the current week), Monthly **`01/04 – 15/04 (to date)`**.



### [Apr 22] Fully-paid invoices falsely flagged as "Deposit Order" (P1) - DONE, VERIFIED
- **Issue**: An invoice with £13.99 total, £13.99 received, £0.00 outstanding was showing the amber "Deposit Order" badge AND the "⚠ DEPOSIT ORDER - Outstanding Balance: £0.00" banner on the printable preview.
- **Root cause**: Classic IEEE-754 floating-point residual. Order type is VAT-inclusive (£13.99); line item ex-VAT price is £11.66. `11.66 + 11.66 × 0.2 = 13.992` (not 13.99). Subtracting deposits £13.99 yields `0.0020000000000006...`, which displays as £0.00 but satisfies `amountOutstanding > 0`, triggering every deposit-order UI branch.
- **Fix** (client-side; backend was already using `> 0.01` tolerance):
  - `Invoice.js::calculateTotals`: clamp `amountOutstanding` to 0 when `|raw| < 0.005`, otherwise round to 2dp. This makes every downstream consumer (print preview, top-right badge, validation, save payload) see a clean 0.
  - `InvoicePrintPreview.js`: banner now checks `> 0.005` as a second defensive guard.
  - `InvoiceHistory.js::getDepositInfo`: returns `safeOutstanding` clamped by the same half-penny rule so legacy rows (where backend persisted `amount_outstanding` with drift) still render as fully paid in the list.
- **Verified**: JS-evaluated scenario in preview — `grossTotal=13.992, totalDeposits=13.99, rawOutstanding=0.002…, amountOutstanding=0, showsDepositOrder=false`. Fix works.



### [Apr 22] One-click "Sync Deposit Date → Invoice Date" (P1) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **What it does**: The Invoice History mis-dated-deposit audit banner now reconciles mis-dated payments in a single click, either bulk (Sync All) or per-row (Sync Now).
- **Backend**: `POST /api/invoices/audit/sync-deposit-dates`
  - Body `{"invoice_ids": [...]}` syncs only those. Empty body / missing → pulls the current audit list and syncs every offender.
  - For each invoice, only the deposits whose date DIFFERS from the invoice date are updated; deposits already on the correct date are untouched. Empty / zero-amount deposits are ignored.
  - Response includes per-invoice `deposits_updated` counts for transparency.
- **Frontend**:
  - `lib/api.js`: `syncDepositDates(invoice_ids = null)` — passes `{invoice_ids}` when provided, `{}` for bulk.
  - `InvoiceHistory.js`:
    - Header now shows an amber `Sync All (N)` primary button beside Review/Refresh; disables while in flight, shows "Syncing…".
    - Each row in the expanded list has a primary `Sync Now` button (one-click fix) and a secondary icon-only Edit button (fallback for edge cases).
    - Post-success: toast summarises `X deposits across Y invoices`, then re-fetches both the invoice list and the audit so the banner count / revenue numbers refresh immediately.
- **Verified on preview**: Inserted 2 invoices (4-day diff on one, multi-deposit with mixed correct/incorrect dates on the other). Per-id sync touched only the targeted row; bulk sync cleaned up the rest. Multi-deposit case correctly left the already-matching deposit alone. Revenue reflows after sync (from 22/04 where the payments were wrongly logged back to the invoice's actual 18/04).



### [Apr 22] Mis-dated Deposit Audit Banner on Invoice History (P1) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **What it does**: Invoice History now shows an amber banner when any invoice has a deposit/payment date that differs from the invoice date by > 1 day. Expanding the banner lists all affected invoices with the specific deposit info, the max diff in days, and a "Fix Deposit Date" button that deep-links to the invoice edit form.
- **Why**: Invoice History attributes revenue by payment date. When a user backdates an invoice but the deposit defaults to today (legacy quotes, careless edits, etc.), the revenue lands on the wrong day. This audit surfaces every such case so historical revenue can be reconciled.
- **Backend**:
  - `GET /api/invoices/audit/mis-dated-deposits` (in `invoices.py` before `/{invoice_id}` to avoid path capture). Scans non-deleted, non-cancelled invoices with a positive-amount deposit; returns those where `abs(deposit_date − invoice_date) > 1 day`. Response sorted by max diff desc so worst cases are shown first.
  - Ignores `amount <= 0` deposits (placeholders) and gracefully skips invoices with unparseable DD/MM/YYYY dates.
- **Frontend**:
  - `lib/api.js`: `getMisDatedDepositInvoices()`.
  - `InvoiceHistory.js`: new `depositAudit` state, fetched alongside `fetchData` on mount/focus/visibility/dataSync. Banner is collapsible, auto-hides at count=0, degrades silently if endpoint fails. "Fix Deposit Date" button looks up the full invoice in `allInvoices` and routes to the invoice edit view (reuses existing `editInvoice` flow).
- **Verified on preview**: Inserted two test invoices — one with a 1-day diff (should be ignored by `> 1 day` rule) and one with a 4-day diff (should appear). Audit correctly returned only the 4-day case. Banner rendered, expansion worked, cleanup removed test rows.



### [Apr 22] Backdated quotes showing today's revenue after conversion (P0) - DONE
- **Issue**: User backdated a quotation to 21/04/2026, converted it → Invoice saved with `date: 21/04/2026` (correct) BUT the payment (deposit) row was auto-dated to `22/04/2026` (today). Invoice History attributes revenue to the deposit's payment date — so the £4,613 appeared in "today's" numbers instead of 21/04's.
- **Root cause**: Three independent date-defaults ignored the quote's original date:
  1. `QuotationHistory.handleConvertToInvoice` & `CashQuotationHistory.handleConvertToInvoice` never passed `quotation.date` / `quotation.time` to the invoice form.
  2. `Invoice.js` initialized `invoiceData.date` to `new Date()` and never updated it from the incoming quote state.
  3. The cash-quote deposit setter (line 348 before fix) hard-coded `new Date()` for the deposit date.
  4. The Invoice Date `<Input>` onChange handler didn't sync matching deposit dates, so even if a user manually backdated the invoice, the payment still sat on today.
- **Fix**:
  - `QuotationHistory.js` & `CashQuotationHistory.js` — carry `date` and `time` from the quote into `fromQuotation` state.
  - `Invoice.js` — `fromQuotation` effect now sets `invoiceData.date` and `invoiceData.time` from the quote, AND syncs any existing deposit whose date matched the old invoice date so the deposit follows the backdate.
  - `Invoice.js` cash-quote deposit setter now reads `prev.date` instead of `new Date()`.
  - `Invoice.js` Date input onChange — when the user manually backdates, any deposit whose date equals the old invoice date is auto-updated to the new date. Deposits intentionally set to a different date are preserved.
- **Effect**: Revenue attribution is now correct end-to-end. A backdated quote → invoice → deposit chain all land on the same day on Invoice History.



### [Apr 22] Orphan Converted-Quotes audit banner on Quotation History (P1) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **What it does**: When the Quotation History page loads, it fetches a new backend audit endpoint that returns any quote with `status=converted` but NO linked invoice (neither via `converted_to_invoice_id` nor via an invoice whose notes contain the quote number). If the count is > 0, an amber banner appears at the top of the page with a **Review** button that expands a table of the orphans (quote number, customer, total, converted at, staff). Super Admins get a **Revert to Active** button per row inline.
- **Backend**:
  - `GET /api/quotations/audit/orphans` → `{"count": N, "orphans": [...]}`. Path placed before `/{quotation_id}` so it's not captured as an id.
  - `POST /api/quotations/{id}/convert-to-invoice` now accepts an optional `{invoice_id}` body, stored on the quote as `converted_to_invoice_id` — this is the stable link the audit endpoint uses first. Fallback matches by `quotation_no` regex in the invoice's `notes` field (handles legacy data).
- **Frontend**:
  - `lib/api.js`: added `getOrphanConvertedQuotations()`; `convertQuotationToInvoice(id, invoice_id)` now forwards the new invoice id.
  - `Invoice.js`: post-save conversion now passes the saved invoice id so the link is recorded.
  - `QuotationHistory.js`: new `orphanAudit` state + fetcher, refreshed on load, on data-sync events, and after revert actions. Banner is collapsible, auto-hides at count=0, and degrades silently if the endpoint isn't reachable.
- **Verified on preview**: Inserted a fake orphan → banner appeared with count=1 + expanded row + Revert button. Cleared test data after.



### [Apr 22] URGENT: Converted quotes not creating invoices / not updating sales (P0) - DONE
- **Issue** (reported): User converted a quote (QT260421150424 £4613 Emily Croucher) but the invoice never appeared in Invoice History and sales numbers weren't updated. Other quotes were affected too.
- **Root cause** (regular-quotation flow was broken, cash-quotation flow was already correct):
  - `QuotationHistory.handleConvertToInvoice` EAGERLY called `POST /quotations/{id}/convert-to-invoice` which marked the quotation as "converted" on the backend.
  - It then navigated to the Invoice form for the user to review & save.
  - **If the user closed the page, reloaded, navigated away, or the save failed — the quote was permanently stuck in "converted" status with NO matching invoice**. Hence: invoice missing, sales numbers unchanged.
  - The parallel cash-quotation flow (`CashQuotationHistory.js`) was already fixed with the correct post-save pattern; regular quotations were overlooked.
- **Fix**:
  - `QuotationHistory.js` — removed the eager convert API call; now only navigates to the invoice form carrying `quotationId` in state (mirrors `CashQuotationHistory.js`).
  - `Invoice.js` — added a new `pendingQuotationId` state, set when `fromQuotation` is a regular (non-cash) quotation. After the invoice save returns successfully, calls `api.convertQuotationToInvoice(pendingQuotationId)` then clears it. If conversion marking fails, shows a warning but doesn't fail the whole save (invoice is what matters).
- **Recovery for the user's stuck quotes**: Use the orange **"Revert to Active"** icon (Super Admin only) on each affected quote in Quotation History to push it back to the active list, then re-run Convert to Invoice with the new flow.
- **Pending**: Deploy to Railway. Also verify no other orphan quotes exist — the user should look at the list of "Converted" quotes in Quotation History and cross-check against Invoice History.



### [Apr 19] "Collection Not Found" for URLs with slashes in dimensions (P0) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **Issue**: Clicking the Herringbone 70 x 350 x 20/5mm collection card produced "Collection Not Found" on production. Root cause was the React Router route `/shop/collection/:seriesName` treating the `/` in `20/5mm` as a path separator — so `:seriesName` only captured `Herringbone 70 x 350 x 20` and the rest (`5mm Engineered Wood`) became an unmatched path segment.
- **Fix**:
  - `App.js`: Changed route to `/shop/collection/*` (splat) so everything after `/shop/collection/` is captured, slashes included.
  - `CollectionDetailPage.js`: Read `useParams()['*']` (with a fallback to `seriesName` for safety).
- **Verification**: On preview, `/shop/collection/Herringbone%2070%20x%20350%20x%2020%2F5mm%20Engineered%20Wood` loads the correct detail page with both Ashford and Kingswood variants visible. Other collection URLs without slashes still work via the fallback.



### [Apr 19] Variants disappearing when finish is selected (P0) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **Issue**: On Herringbone 90x300x14/3mm, the variant picker had 4 swatches (Borrowdale, Glastonbury, Harrogate, Windermere). Clicking any variant auto-selected its finish, which then hid the other two variants whose finishes were different — so the user lost the ability to browse the full collection.
- **Cause**: Old Rule 5 in `business_rules.py` explicitly required hiding variants when a finish was selected. The render loop in `CollectionDetailPage.js` (lines 2049-2056) implemented this by computing `notInCurrentFinish` and returning `null`.
- **Fix**:
  - `CollectionDetailPage.js`: Removed the variant-hiding check — variants are now ALWAYS visible. Clicking any variant still auto-switches the finish/size to one available for that variant (existing `availableFinishesForColor` effect).
  - `business_rules.py` Rule 5: Reworded to state variants are the top-level collection navigation and must always be visible.
- **Preserved**: Rule 4 (hide finishes that don't apply to the selected variant) and Rule 6 (hide sizes that don't apply) are unchanged — finish/size pickers still filter correctly.
- **Verification**: On preview, clicking Windermere keeps all 4 swatches visible, shows only the "White Brushed UV Lacquered" finish (Windermere's actual finish), and the selection is correctly highlighted.



### [Apr 19] Pattern/Style selector leaking variant names (P0) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PREVIEW
- **Issue**: On the Herringbone 90x300x14/3mm detail page, the "Pattern" selector was showing "Borrowdale Oak UV Lacquered 90x300x14/3mm" and "Windermere Oak UV Lacquered 90x300x14/3mm" — these are just variant names duplicated, not real patterns.
- **Root cause** in `CollectionDetailPage.js → getStyleLabel`:
  1. Products have no saved `color`, so the variant picker uses the first word of the name as the swatch label — but `getStyleLabel` never stripped this first word, so the variant name leaked into the Pattern label.
  2. Size regex only matched 2-dim sizes (`60x60`), so 3-dim sizes like `90x300x14/3mm` left cruft after stripping.
  3. Material/type words like "Oak", "UV", "Lacquered" weren't stripped, leaving noise in the label.
- **Fix**: `CollectionDetailPage.js:398–438`
  - When no saved colour is present, strip the first word of the product name (which IS the variant swatch label).
  - Added a 3-dim size regex that runs before the 2-dim one (handles `WxHxD[/D]mm` patterns).
  - Extended finish-word list (`uv, oil, oiled, lacquered, limed, white`) and added a material-noise list (`oak, wood, engineered, porcelain, ceramic, marble, stone, glass, spc, lvt, vinyl`) so only genuine pattern names (e.g. Linear vs Stripe) survive.
- **Verification**: Pattern label is NOT present in the DOM on preview — only the legitimate Variant / Finish / Size pickers are shown. The Bestone "Linear vs Stripe Decor" case still works because those products have a saved colour and the genuine "Linear"/"Stripe" pattern words aren't in the strip-list.



### [Apr 19] Fix Herringbone 70x350x10/2.5mm appearing in All Tiles group (P0) - DONE, VERIFIED ON PROD
- **Issue**: On production, 2 of 3 Canopy Herringbone SKUs (`HE7013FSC`, `HE7012FSC`) had `product_group: "tiles"` on the `tiles` collection while 1 (`HE7018FSC`) had `"flooring"`. Result: Herringbone wrongly appeared on `/tiles` (All Tiles) page as a 2-variant card, and `/flooring` only showed 1 variant.
- **Root cause**: `supplier_products` had `product_group: null` AND `main_category: null` for these 3 SKUs (never set in admin editor). Previous `/fix-tiles-product-group` endpoint read from `supplier_products`, so with null source it couldn't fix tiles.
- **Fix (deployed via existing endpoint)**: Called `POST /api/supplier-sync/products/bulk-update-unified` with `{"product_ids": [HE7013FSC, HE7018FSC, HE7012FSC], "updates": {"main_category": "Flooring"}, "id_field": "sku"}`. This auto-syncs `main_category` → `product_group` on both `supplier_products` and `tiles`.
- **Additional hardening (in code, pending deploy)**: Enhanced `/api/supplier-sync/fix-tiles-product-group` (`supplier_sync.py:2764`) to accept an optional `product_group` override that force-sets the value on BOTH `tiles` and `supplier_products` collections — useful for future ad-hoc repairs.
- **Verification**:
  - `/api/tiles/collections?group=flooring` → Herringbone 70 x 350 x 10/2.5mm now shows count=3, 3 variants.
  - `/api/tiles/collections?group=tiles` → 0 Herringbone collections (correctly excluded).
  - All 3 SKUs report `product_group: "flooring"` on tiles DB.



### 1. Spec/Filter Group Isolation (P0) - DONE, TESTED
- Specs and filters now scoped to product groups via `product_groups` field
- Bulk Scope feature: multi-select + assign to groups in one click
- Backend: `POST /api/specifications/types/bulk-assign-group`, `POST /api/filters/types/bulk-assign-group`
- 27/27 backend tests passed

### 2. Product Subtitle Fix - DONE
- Subtitle shows `supplier_product_name || original_series` instead of display name
- Backend API returns computed fallback so even old frontend code works
- Removed `name` from quick-edit save to prevent display name overwriting supplier name

### 3. Product Copy Fix - DONE
- Copied products now get their own `supplier_code` and `sort_order +0.5`
- Preserves `series`/`original_series` for correct grouping

### 4. Per-Page Pagination Fix - DONE
- Added `productsPerPage` to `fetchProducts` useCallback dependency array
- Changing "Per page" dropdown now actually fetches that many products

### 5. Null SKU Migration Fix - DONE
- Fixed duplicate dict key bug: `{"$ne": None, "$ne": ""}` collapsed to `{"$ne": ""}`
- Changed to `{"$exists": True, "$nin": [None, ""]}`

### 6. Category Duplicate Check - DONE
- Now scoped per-group: "All Products" can exist in Tiles AND Flooring independently

### 7. Tier Pricing Model - DONE
- Changed `tier_discounts` and `tier_thresholds` from `int` to `float` (supports 7.5%)
- Tier labels show clean integers: "10m2" not "10.0m2"

### 8. Multi-Select Room Suitability - DONE
- Per-product assignment changed from single dropdown to multi-select checkboxes

### 9. Storefront Collection Fixes - DONE
- `:path` route converter for series names with `/` (e.g. "80x300x10/3mm")
- Substring fallback search with space-normalization for dimension names
- Surface product merge: single-product groups sharing size+material+supplier get merged
- Merge threshold: `>=2` singles (was `>3`)

### 10. Flexible Variant Display - DONE
- Products WITHOUT saved colour show first word of display name as swatch
- Products WITH saved colour show colour swatches only — NEVER mixed
- Backend `get_product_color` only uses saved DB field, never extracts from name
- Swatch labels capitalized
- Disabled finish/colour tabs hidden entirely (not faded)

### 11. Pattern Selector - DONE
- Shows only when products share same colour+finish+size (true duplicates)
- Extracts clean labels by removing series, colour, finish words, size from name
- Resets when colour or finish changes

### 12. Dual Quantity Inputs - DONE
- m2 and Box inputs both visible (no toggle), stacked
- Only shows for surface products with sqm_per_box

### 13. Scroll to Top + Back to Top Button - DONE
- Global ScrollToTop component on every route/page change
- Floating up-arrow button appears when scrolled past 400px

### 14. Scope Save Fix (P0) - DONE
- Old scalar fields (`finish`, `edge`, etc.) were overriding scoped filter values
- Fixed both `handleBulkCategoryUpdate` and `handleForceSave`
- Scoped filter_* arrays now take precedence over pre-populated scalars

### 15. WAS Price Auto-Recalculation - DONE
- When list price changes, `was_price` auto-recalculates if sale is active
- Updates both `supplier_products` and `tiles`

### 16. Tiles Collection Sync Fix - DONE
- `tiles` collection uses `supplier_name` not `supplier`
- Added `skip_supplier_filter=True` for tiles updates in `bulk-update-unified`
- Prices and product_group changes now propagate to storefront

### 17. Virtual Filter Groups for New Product Groups - DONE
- When a product group (e.g. Flooring) has no dedicated filter group, auto-builds one
- Uses filter types scoped to that group or unscoped ones
- No cross-contamination: only shows relevant filters

### 18. Ultra Tile 5% Price Increase - DONE
- 81 products: cost_price increased by 5%, list price preserved at 2x markup
- Both supplier_products and tiles updated

### 19. Copy-From Saved Scopes - DONE  
- "Copy from..." popup now shows previously saved value breakdowns
- Can copy scope from "Products with 20mm saved (6)" etc.

### 20. `fix-tiles-product-group` Endpoint - DONE
- Syncs `product_group` from `supplier_products` to `tiles` by SKU

## CRITICAL: What Needs Deploying

ALL fixes are in the codebase but many have NOT been deployed to Railway production yet.
The user reports "none of the fixes are working" — this is a DEPLOYMENT issue, not a code issue.

### Production-Blocking Issues:
1. **`logger` crash was deployed** — `logger.info()` inside `_get_tile_collections_impl` crashed the entire collections endpoint (NameError: 'logger' not defined). This was FIXED and the debug logging removed, but if old code was deployed, it would break ALL collection pages.
2. **Tiles supplier filter bug** — `skip_supplier_filter` fix not deployed, so saves don't propagate to tiles on production.
3. **2 Canopy tiles still have product_group: "tiles"** instead of "flooring" on production.

### Deploy Checklist:
- [ ] Deploy latest code to Railway
- [ ] Call `POST /api/supplier-sync/fix-tiles-product-group` with `{"skus":["HE7013FSC","HE7012FSC"]}` on production
- [ ] Verify collections page loads (no logger crash)
- [ ] Verify 70x350 herringbone shows 3 variants
- [ ] Verify flooring filters sidebar appears
